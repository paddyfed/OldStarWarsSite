            <h1>January 23, 2003</h1>
            <p>I've had an email from one of the webmasters from <a href="404.html">DewbackWing Europe</a>, he says that there is a section of their forum set up
                specifically for Irish people. DewbackWing are mainly concerned with creating props and costumes from Star
                Wars but they also have some RPG areas of the site. Check out the site <a
                    href="404.html">here</a>.<br><br>As you know the Trivia
                competition has finished for a while again. Now I'm wondering, when I start the trivia competition again,
                should I start the Trivia Table from scratch again or should it be continued on from the last one? Or should
                I create a trivia table for the first five, the last five and the next five trivia competitions? Seeing as
                ye are the ones who participate in the Trivia competitions you should have your input on the subject. Just
                send us an <a href="contact.html">e-mail</a>.<br><br>In other news my other web-site, <a
                    href="404.html">PaddyFedoo ONLINE</a>, (link may no longer be
                accessable) is having a bit of trouble. ProHosting who host the site are trying to make me pay for it and
                while it must be said it is a low enough sum I'm just not prepared to pay for the service which is at best,
                crap. So if you know of any FREE hosting sites out there with FTP support, let us know.</p>

            <h1>January 2, 2003</h1>
            <p>I know, I know I've been idle on the site for a month and I'm sorry about that. Things just kept getting in
                the way. Any way belated Merry Christmas and Happy 2003 to you all. I hope you all had a good one and
                looking forward to another Star Wars packed year.<br><br>In terms of the site, not much has happened. The
                trivia contest is over and Gabe has won again, however without anyone else entering. Still nevermind. I
                think I'll take a small break from the trivia for a while. It'll give me a bit of time to gather some more
                questions. Rest assured it will be back and quicker than the last break. There's also something important I
                need to ask you (ie those who participate in the trivia). More about that later though.</p>
