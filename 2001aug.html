Here is an excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE>Science fiction will be brought down to earth with a futuristic look at Belfast in the year 3001, as well as sci-fi offerings from cult directors George Lucas and Stanly Kubrick.</BLOCKQUOTE>Pretty cool. As well as this they had a familiar character on the streets of Belfast launching the festival. For a scan of the full article <A HREF="filmfest_article.jpg" TARGET="_blank" class="news">click here</A>.<BR><BR>There is a new poll up and the results of the last poll have been archived. The results are interesting, the majority of visitors to the site that participated don't mind the new Episode II title. <A HREF="poll_res.html" TARGET="_blank" class="news">View the results</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>August 21&#44; 2001</P><P>Sorry for no recent updates. I've just come back from my holiday to Tenerife. I had a great time and I hope to tell you all about it soon :P<BR><BR>A new member has joined the ISW, the first since our first birthday. Welcome to Eamonn Reilly.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>August 8&#44; 2001</P><P>Well, what a time to have our birthday celebrations. Big announcements have been made in the Star Wars world. The title for Episode II has been officially announced as 'Attack of the Clones'. Many people hate the title, saying it's too cheesy or sounds too much like 'clowns'. I, myself, like the title and don't have a problem with it. <A HREF="cont.html" class="news">What do you think?</A><BR><BR>There's a new poll up. I know it's very similar to the poll on <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">TheForce.net</A>, but I'm interested in the opinions of the visitors to this site.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>August 2&#44; 2001</P><P>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE ISW!!! On this day, exactly 1 year ago, I created this website for all Irish Star Wars fans. In that time we have had over 1400 visitors and 26 members joined the group. I'd like to thank everyone who has shown support for the club and all the visitors and members. Lets hope we are here for another year.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
