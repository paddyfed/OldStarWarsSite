<P>August 19, 2002</P><P>This weeks RTÉ Guide has Liam Neeson as their 'Star of the Week' and his film 'Rob Roy' (which supposidly got him his Star Wars role) is on Wednesday 21st at 9.30, RTÉ1. <A HREF="rteguide_neesonstar.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Click here</A> to read the article.<BR><BR>I also saw something very exciting during the ads for RTÉ's new season. I saw clips for 'Star Wars: A New Hope', 'Return of the Jedi' and, yes, 'The Phantom Menace'. So it looks like TPM will get its first terrestrial airing on Irish TV. I didn't notice any clips for 'The Empire Strikes Back' though. It also poses many questions like which versions will they be showing? Even between the VHS and DVD versions of TPM there are differences. And how far apart will the showings be? Weekly, daily? Rest assured I'll try to keep you updated.<BR><BR>The new trivia competition has got off to a great start. Well done to Nick Murdoch, Patricia and Darth Ewok for getting the awards. Both the results and the Trivia Table have been updated. Also check out Set VII of the competition.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>August 7, 2002</P><P>I've extended the Trivia deadline by a week cause I've had very few entries. The Gold award has been taken but there's still a chance for someone to take the silver & bronze awards. Not to mention the Trivia Table leader board.<BR><BR>It also seems that visitors to the site can't get enough of Star Wars collectables according to the result of the <A HREF="pollresults.html" TARGET="iswpoll">recent poll</A>.<BR><BR>November 11th is the confirmed date of the UK Episode II VHS/DVD release.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>August 2, 2002</P><P>Woohoo! we have confirmation on when the Episode II VHS/DVD will be released. November 12th, just over 3 months away. The unofficial release date for the UK is November 11th. I will be buying the VHS version and can't wait to bring Episode II home.<BR><BR>Today is the ISW's Second Birthday. These past two years have just flown by. I never imagined or expected the site to last this long. My hopes of <A HREF="arc_01-08.html">last year</A> were realised. We now have 34 members and over 2500 visitors.<BR><BR>July 2002 have been added to the archves.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
