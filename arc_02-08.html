            <h1>August 19, 2002</h1>
            <p>This weeks RTÉ Guide has Liam Neeson as their 'Star of the Week' and his film 'Rob Roy' (which supposidly got
                him his Star Wars role) is on Wednesday 21st at 9.30, RTÉ1. <a href="rteguide_neesonstar.jpg"
                onclick="showImage('rteguide_neesonstar.jpg','Liam Neeson: Star of the Week'); return false;">Click here</a> to read the article.<br><br>I also saw something very exciting during the
                ads for RTÉ's new season. I saw clips for 'Star Wars: A New Hope', 'Return of the Jedi' and, yes, 'The
                Phantom Menace'. So it looks like TPM will get its first terrestrial airing on Irish TV. I didn't notice any
                clips for 'The Empire Strikes Back' though. It also poses many questions like which versions will they be
                showing? Even between the VHS and DVD versions of TPM there are differences. And how far apart will the
                showings be? Weekly, daily? Rest assured I'll try to keep you updated.<br><br>The new trivia competition has
                got off to a great start. Well done to Nick Murdoch, Patricia and Darth Ewok for getting the awards. Both
                the results and the Trivia Table have been updated. Also check out Set VII of the competition.</p>

            <p>I've extended the Trivia deadline by a week cause I've had very few entries. The Gold award has been taken
                but there's still a chance for someone to take the silver & bronze awards. Not to mention the Trivia Table
                leader board.<br><br>It also seems that visitors to the site can't get enough of Star Wars collectables
                according to the result of the <a href="pollresults.html">recent poll</a>.<br><br>November
                11th is the confirmed date of the UK Episode II VHS/DVD release.</p>

            <p>Woohoo! we have confirmation on when the Episode II VHS/DVD will be released. November 12th, just over 3
                months away. The unofficial release date for the UK is November 11th. I will be buying the VHS version and
                can't wait to bring Episode II home.<br><br>Today is the ISW's Second Birthday. These past two years have
                just flown by. I never imagined or expected the site to last this long. My hopes of <a
                    href="arc_01-08.html">last year</a> were realised. We now have 34 members and over 2500
                visitors.<br><br>July 2002 have been added to the archves.</p>
