            <p>Steve Boyle has become the 21st member of the ISW and the first to join since January 2001. Welcome to
                him.<br><br>As its the last day in March the archives will be added to. Also I want to expand the links
                section of the site so if you have any links that you wish to have added then <a
                    href="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">mail me</a>.<br><br>A new poll is up on the main page also. If you have
                any questions that you believe would make a good poll then <a href="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">mail me</a>.

            <h1>March 24, 2001</h1>
            <p>Well St. Patrick's week-end is well and truly over. I hope you enjoyed it wherever you were.<br><br>I got an
                e-mail from Collect World Events telling me of a Star Wars convention 'Jedicon' taking place over in England
                on the 22nd of April. <a href="swcon.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to find out more or visit the <a
                    href="https://www.scifishows.com" target="_blank">'Jedicon' site</a>.</p>

            <h1>March 10, 2001</h1>
            <p>As I'm not sure where I'll be on St Patrick's Day this year I have decided to put up the 'decorations' a week
                early. So if I don't update next week (17th March) Happy St. Patrick's Day.<br><br>I would also like to warn
                those from the Republic who may be thinking of subscribing to the official Star Wars magazine that you need
                to pay in pounds Sterling not in Punts. I've learned this the hard way and I hope I've prevented someone
                from making the same mistake.<br><br>With the recent 'announcement' on <a href="https://www.theforce.net"
                    target="_blank">TheForce.net</a> that Episode II may be released worldwide at the same time that would
                make the countdown on the site wrong. However I have decided to keep it as it is until there is official
                word from Lucasfilm. The article can be found on <a href="https://www.theforce.net/episode2"
                    target="_blank">TheForce.net's Episode II page</a>.</p>

            <h1>March 3, 2001</h1>
            <p>The archives have been added to include February 2001. I am also looking to restart the Trivia competitions
                but I don't have the time (or patience) to make up and correct questions. If any visitor or member of the
                site thinks that they will be able to do this please <a href="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">e-mail
                    me</a>.<br><br>There is also a new poll on the site and the results of the last poll have been recorded.
