            <h1>January 14, 2002</h1>
            <p>This weeks RTÉ Guide (12-18 January) has a small article on everyone's favourite topic.
            <blockquote>It seems that squeaky-clean 'Nsync have managed to scam parts in the next Star Wars installment,
                Attack of the Clones. The boys appear briefly in a battle scene and are thankfully hacked to bits by a light
                sabre.</blockquote>To see a scan of the article, which appeared in the Guide's BackChat section, <a
                href="rteguide_nsync.JPG" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br><br>I have the 'Link to Us' section finally up
            which I think completes all sections of the site converted to Version 3. I know it took a long time but it's
            finally done.</p>

                time. The Trivia results are now up again for you to re-live past glories. They can be found in the Archives
                scetion. Also December 2001 has been added to the News Archives. Finally the past Poll results are now
                complete up to the last poll on the site.<br><br>I was browsing around the other day and when I went to the
                <a href="https://www.dudestudios.com" target="_blank">DudeStudios.com</a> site I saw that Rich Cando is
                doing his own 'Select' pictures for his upcoming Flash film 'Star Dudes: Episode I'. What was interesting
                about this is that our mascot Yoda is in one of them. (Picture taken from <a
