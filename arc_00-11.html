<P>November 25&#44; 2000</P><P>Well here in Ireland we are certainly getting into the Christmas spirit. It seems to come earlier and earlier every year. With this in mind I'd like to introduce you to the Christmas 2000 design for the site. I hope that you like it.<BR><BR>"The Muppet's Treasure Island" featuring Frank Oz was on RT&#201; 1 today. Thanks to Tipplehilti for the report.<BR><BR>I have spotted the new Star Wars trilogy videos in Tescos price IR£24.99. Unfortunatly it wasn't the widescreen version which is what I'm looking for and the boxes weren't in the best condition. However the packaging does look cool. If you have wached the videos or if you've seen them anywhere else <A CLASS="news" HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">let us know what you thought</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 19&#44; 2000</P><P><A CLASS="news" HREF="http://www.rte.ie/tv/bullisland" TARGET="_blank">Bull Island</A>, the Irish political satire show, recently did a sketch on the state of Eircom and its shareholders in a Star Wars style. Luke and Darth Vader were fighting over ownership of Eircom. Obi-Wan Kenobi (01 Kenobi if you're outside Dublin) represented the shareholders in the banter. A very funny sketch.<BR><BR>PhantomShadow's page 'The AFS Galactic Senate' has been added to the <A HREF="links_member.html" CLASS="news">members links</A> page. It tries to address a few of the more contriversial elements of Star Wars. We also have a new guestbook, the old one was too dificult to administer and looked very cluttered. I hope to see a few entries in there.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 18&#44; 2000</P><P>It's all change here at the ISW. Not only has the design of the site changed but we also have a new forum, courtesy of <A CLASS="news" HREF="http://www.galacticempire.net" TARGET="_blank">GalacticEmpire.net's</A> Imperial Senate. You can access the <A CLASS="news" HREF="http://cgi.galacticempire.plus.com/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&number=15&start=here" TARGET="iswforum">forum</A> by the link to the left. I'd like to thank the Emperor for allowing us to use his forum. I hope that all members will use it.<BR><BR>I have also decided to suspend the Trivia competitions for the moment. This is due to low entry levels and because I am running out of quesions to ask. There is a question on the page but you don't have to answer it.  After a while I will think about starting them up again. I will keep you posted. The winner (and only entrant of) Trivia Set V is Ian Motter. Well done to him.<BR><BR>The results of the latest poll are also in. They can be viewed <A CLASS="news" HREF="pollresults.html" target="iswpoll">here</A>. A new poll has also been set. <A CLASS="news" HREF="poll.html" target="iswpoll">If you could ask George Lucas one thing, what would it be?</A></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 12&#44; 2000</P><P>Rob Dalton's site has been added to the members links site. It is a very interesting site with a few documents on why Star Wars is better than Star Trek. Very neatly put together as well. Head over to the <A CLASS="news" HREF="links_member.html">members links</A> page to find the link.<BR><BR>In the 'Ireland on Sunday' it has an article on what Liam Neeson will be up to next.<BLOCKQUOTE>Irish actor Liam Neeson has decided to enter the sensitive arena of Northern politics again by narrating a documentary on the history of the Maze prison.<BR>Neeson will narrate an RTE/Channel 4 co-production on the history of the troubled jail which permanently closed last month after 30 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>It says the show will be shown on RTE 1 on Tuesday week.<BR><BR>In other news, I have been unable to contact both Ger and Balzacamadeus recently. Their e-mail addresses (mrmax_power@hotmail.com and waterphall@hotmail.com) are no longer working for reasons beyond me. If they could <A CLASS="news" HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">contact me</A> and tell me what the problem is or a different e-mail address to be contacted by then I would be greatful.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 11&#44; 2000</P><P>I have been thinking of a new section for the site. It would be a 'Featured site of the week' section. Each week we would have a Star Wars site that you think is worthy of everyone's attention. If you think this is a good idea, or if you think you have the first featured site, then <A CLASS="news" HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">tell me</A>.<BR><BR>A few of the sections have also had a slight change.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 10&#44; 2000</P><P>Stev Adams is now the 15th member of the ISW and has been added to the members page.<BR><BR>Our friend, Rich Cando, creator of 'Star Dudes' has released the trailer for his upcoming Flash 4 film 'Return of the Dude'. It can be found <A CLASS="news"  HREF="http://www.theforce.net/theater/comingsoon/returndude/" TARGET="_blank">here</A>. Also visit <A CLASS="news" HREF="http://www.dudestudios.com" TARGET="_blank">dudestudios.com</A> to see screenshots for the upcoming feature.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 4&#44; 2000</P><P>Well the results of Trivia set IV are in and PhantomShadow is on top again with Tipplehilti getting the silver award. Rob Dalton gets the first Bronze award of the club. Trivia set V is now up, this time with an 'Expanded Universe' theme. Closing date 18th of November.<BR><BR>The polls page has been tidied up with the results of previous polls on another page. This is to ensure that the polls page itself won't take ages to load.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 3&#44; 2000</P><P>October 2000 has been added to the Archives page which has also had a small make-over. A new poll is also up in the Poll section along with the results of last weeks poll. The new poll was inspired by a thread on AFS that I read last week. I hope it'll be an interesting one.<BR><BR>Harrison Ford is featured in a television program on TV3, an Irish station, called 'Legends'. It is on Sunday (5th November) at 7.00 PM.<BR><BR>Trivia set IV is nearly over. If anyone wants to enter they'd need to do it soon.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
