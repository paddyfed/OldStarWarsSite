            <h1>November 25, 2000</h1>
            <p>Well here in Ireland we are certainly getting into the Christmas spirit. It seems to come earlier and earlier
                every year. With this in mind I'd like to introduce you to the Christmas 2000 design for the site. I hope
                that you like it.<br><br>"The Muppet's Treasure Island" featuring Frank Oz was on RTÉ 1 today. Thanks to
                Tipplehilti for the report.<br><br>I have spotted the new Star Wars trilogy videos in Tescos price IR£24.99.
                Unfortunatly it wasn't the widescreen version which is what I'm looking for and the boxes weren't in the
                best condition. However the packaging does look cool. If you have wached the videos or if you've seen them
                anywhere else <a href="contact.html">let us know what you thought</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rte.ie/tv/bullisland" target="_blank">Bull Island</a>, the Irish political satire show,
                recently did a sketch on the state of Eircom and its shareholders in a Star Wars style. Luke and Darth Vader
                were fighting over ownership of Eircom. Obi-Wan Kenobi (01 Kenobi if you're outside Dublin) represented the
                shareholders in the banter. A very funny sketch.<br><br>PhantomShadow's page 'The AFS Galactic Senate' has
                been added to the <a href="links.html">members links</a> page. It tries to address a few
                of the more contriversial elements of Star Wars. We also have a new guestbook, the old one was too dificult
                to administer and looked very cluttered. I hope to see a few entries in there.</p>

            <h1>November 18, 2000</h1>
            <p>It's all change here at the ISW. Not only has the design of the site changed but we also have a new forum,
                courtesy of <a href="404.html">GalacticEmpire.net's</a> Imperial
                Senate. You can access the <a
                    href="https://cgi.galacticempire.plus.com/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&number=15&start=here">forum</a>
                by the link to the left. I'd like to thank the Emperor for allowing us to use his forum. I hope that all
                members will use it.<br><br>I have also decided to suspend the Trivia competitions for the moment. This is
                due to low entry levels and because I am running out of quesions to ask. There is a question on the page but
                you don't have to answer it. After a while I will think about starting them up again. I will keep you
                posted. The winner (and only entrant of) Trivia Set V is Ian Motter. Well done to him.<br><br>The results of
                the latest poll are also in. They can be viewed <a href="pollresults.html">here</a>. A new poll has also
                been set. <a href="poll.html">If you could ask George Lucas one thing, what would it be?</a></p>

            <h1>November 12, 2000</h1>
            <p>Rob Dalton's site has been added to the members links site. It is a very interesting site with a few
                documents on why Star Wars is better than Star Trek. Very neatly put together as well. Head over to the <a
                    href="links_member.html">members links</a> page to find the link.<br><br>In the 'Ireland on Sunday' it
                has an article on what Liam Neeson will be up to next.
            <blockquote>Irish actor Liam Neeson has decided to enter the sensitive arena of Northern politics again by
                narrating a documentary on the history of the Maze prison.<br>Neeson will narrate an RTÉ/Channel 4
                co-production on the history of the troubled jail which permanently closed last month after 30 years.
            </blockquote>It says the show will be shown on RTÉ 1 on Tuesday week.<br><br>In other news, I have been unable
            to contact both Ger and Balzacamadeus recently. Their e-mail addresses (mrmax_power@hotmail.com and
            waterphall@hotmail.com) are no longer working for reasons beyond me. If they could <a
                href="contact.html">contact me</a> and tell me what the problem is or a different e-mail address
            to be contacted by then I would be greatful.</p>

            <h1>November 11, 2000</h1>
            <p>I have been thinking of a new section for the site. It would be a 'Featured site of the week' section. Each
                week we would have a Star Wars site that you think is worthy of everyone's attention. If you think this is a
                good idea, or if you think you have the first featured site, then <a href="contact.html">tell
                    me</a>.<br><br>A few of the sections have also had a slight change.</p>

                results of previous polls on another page. This is to ensure that the polls page itself won't take ages to

            <h1>November 3, 2000</h1>
            <p>October 2000 has been added to the Archives page which has also had a small make-over. A new poll is also up
                in the Poll section along with the results of last weeks poll. The new poll was inspired by a thread on AFS
                that I read last week. I hope it'll be an interesting one.<br><br>Harrison Ford is featured in a television
