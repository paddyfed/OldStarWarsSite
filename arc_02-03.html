            <h1>March 30, 2002</h1>
            <p>Not much happening on the site these days. On <a href="https://www.2fm.ie" target="_blank">2fm</a> a few
                mornings ago they ran the story of <a href="404.html">AICN.com</a> and the
                supposed private screening of AOTC. It was only a short bit and they commented that the guy who saw it
                seemed to like it.</p>

            <p>Happy, St. Patrick's Day everybody.<br><br>GA Daemon, a member of an online gaming and RPG organisation
                recently contacted me concerning Star Wars game playing in Ireland. I said I didn't know if anyone is
                interested in playing online Star Wars games but I said I would pass on his URL anyway. <a
                    href="https://www.imperialnexus.net/" target="_blank">www.imperialnexus.net</a>. Check it out if you're
                interested.</p>

            <p>Just over 2 months left until the release of Episode II and you've probably noticed the excitement build.
                Also only a week left until the latest trailer (Trailer D "Clone Wars") is released and I certainly can't
                wait to see it. I was also recently thinking that it would be pretty cool if we (as a Star Wars fan club)
                met up and went to see Epsode II somewhere together. I'm not very good at organising such trips so I'd have
                to pass responsability to someone else but if there is any interest in this <a href="contact.html">e-mail
                    me</a>.<br><br>As a side note the archives for February have been added.</p>
