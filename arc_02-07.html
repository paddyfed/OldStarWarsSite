<P>July 26, 2002</P><P>Naga Sadow has become the newest member of the ISW. Welcome, welcome. Please enter the trivia :P<BR><BR>On a side note if you're looking for a different kind of Trivia competition, completly Expanded Universe orientated, look no further than the <A HREF="http://go.to/nsohome" TARGET="_blank">NSO Praxium</A>. I'm currently second in the table there & hopefully that's where I'll stay :)</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>July 13, 2002</P><P>On Sunday night at 1.30am, RT� 1 are showing George Lucas' first ever feature film: <I>THX 1138</I>. This is what the RT� Guide had to say about the film.<BLOCKQUOTE>A sci-fi curio which has earned cult status chiefly for being the film that started the movie career of a young buck by the name of George Lucas. Adapted from Lucas's student film, <I>THX 1138</I> stars Robert Duvall and Donald Pleasance and is set in a futuristic world where technology dictates and mankind is reduced to soulless drones. As a first film, it's an interesting effort. Wonder what ever happened to the tyro writer/director?</BLOCKQUOTE></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>July 8, 2002</P><P>The Trivia Contest is back!!! I've decided to bring it back because Traffic to the site has increased in the last few months and I hope people will participate. The questions are easy enough. Also I have a new Trivia Table which tracks the progress of those who participate. As usuaul there are no great prizes for winning just a gold star, like primary school :).<BR><BR>Today I also e-mailed the members of the ISW and found that a number of peoples e-mail addresses were not working. I have compiled a MIA list (missing in action) of all members that I cannot contact. If you know these members and are able to contact them then ask them to <A HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">e-mail me</A>. I'm trying to update the members section of the site. <A HREF="member_mia.html">Click here</A> for the MIA list.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>July 2, 2002</P><P>Well as it turns out Galactic Empire UK has not closed it's doors for good. A notice on the site says it will re-open in late summer. Hopefully Palps will be able to resolve all the band width issues that he has and comes back with an even better site.<BR><BR>There's a new poll up and June 2002 has been archived.<BR><BR>Also don't forget to see Star Dudes Episode I: "The Phantom Dude". It's been out for a while but I don't think I've said anything. Find the link on <A HREF="http://www.dudestudios.com" TARGET="_blank">dudestudios.com</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
