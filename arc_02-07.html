                for a different kind of Trivia competition, completly Expanded Universe orientated, look no further than the

            <h1>July 13, 2002</h1>
            <p>On Sunday night at 1.30am, RTÉ 1 are showing George Lucas' first ever feature film: <i>THX 1138</i>. This is
                what the RTÉ Guide had to say about the film.
            <blockquote>A sci-fi curio which has earned cult status chiefly for being the film that started the movie career
                of a young buck by the name of George Lucas. Adapted from Lucas's student film, <i>THX 1138</i> stars Robert
                Duvall and Donald Pleasance and is set in a futuristic world where technology dictates and mankind is
                reduced to soulless drones. As a first film, it's an interesting effort. Wonder what ever happened to the
                tyro writer/director?</blockquote>

            <p>The Trivia Contest is back!!! I've decided to bring it back because Traffic to the site has increased in the
                last few months and I hope people will participate. The questions are easy enough. Also I have a new Trivia
                Table which tracks the progress of those who participate. As usuaul there are no great prizes for winning
                just a gold star, like primary school <i aria-hidden="true"
                    class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i>.<br><br>Today I also e-mailed the members of the ISW and found
                that a number of peoples e-mail addresses were not working. I have compiled a MIA list (missing in action)
                of all members that I cannot contact. If you know these members and are able to contact them then ask them
                to <a href="contact.html">e-mail me</a>. I'm trying to update the members section of the site. <a
                    href="member_mia.html">Click here</a> for the MIA list.</p>

            <p>Well as it turns out Galactic Empire UK has not closed it's doors for good. A notice on the site says it will
                re-open in late summer. Hopefully Palps will be able to resolve all the band width issues that he has and
                comes back with an even better site.<br><br>There's a new poll up and June 2002 has been
                archived.<br><br>Also don't forget to see Star Dudes Episode I: "The Phantom Dude". It's been out for a
                while but I don't think I've said anything. Find the link on <a href="https://www.dudestudios.com"
