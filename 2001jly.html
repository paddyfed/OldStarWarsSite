<P>July 31&#44; 2001</P><P>I was going to put the pop-up ads on the site this week but judging by the response to the latest poll I think I'll wait awhile. However I do want peoples opinions. If we don't have the pop-up ads, why not and are there any other alternatives?<BR><BR>The site has also had a few changes in the background which should ensure faster loading (I hope).<BR><BR>July 2001 has been added to the archives.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 22&#44; 2001</P><P>I have recieved a new application for membership of the ISW however, I am skeptical of the authenticity of the applicant. However I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Welcome to Euan McGregor to the ISW.<BR><BR>The ISW Chat Room is now open. You don't have to register to use the chat room and it's completly free. Please check it out and tell me what you think.<BR><BR>A new poll has been set and the previous poll results have been recorded.<BR><BR>Trivia set VI is now open and to celebrate our affiliation with GalacticEmpire.net it is a special Trivia set all about the website.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 12&#44; 2001</P><P>Sorry about the rude alert but this editorial is very important and I want everyone to read it. The poll has been moved to a different page because it was getting too cluttered on the page.<BR><BR>We have now been affiliated with <A HREF="http://www.galacticempire.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">The Galactic Empire Network</A> run by Palpatine. I have always believed that this was an inevitable affiliation seeing as we use some of the features from the site. In celebration of this I will be dedicating our sixth Trivia competition to the site.<BR><BR>If you read the notice on GEN about our affiliation you will see that Palpatine uses my real name and perhaps it is time that I stopped hiding behind this anon. name (ISW Admin) and used my own. My name is Patrick but my friends call me Paddy and I've been a serious fan of Star Wars ever since I got the videos in 1995. I live in Co. Monaghan in Ireland and I go to college in Letterkenny. Recently I have started building a <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/paddyfedoo" TARGET="_blank" class="news">site for myself</A> but it's pretty empty at the minute. I like to use my online persona, PaddyFedoo, for posting to newsgroups and chat-rooms.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 10&#44; 2001</P><P>The requests page is now open. I hope you will all view it and see what type of service that it is. I hope that this will be a regular feature and that I won't have to abandon it after a week :). <BR><BR>As you can see, yes I do have plans to introduce a chat section very soon. Keep your eye out for that.<BR><BR>I have also managed to scrape togeher a few trivia questions so I hope to be restarting that. I hope our 3 times champion, PhantomShadow, is ready to defend his title.<BR><BR>I also have some more important updates and announcements soon so please keep in touch.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 2&#44; 2001</P><P>Thanks to those who tested out the message service. It seems to be working just fine. Check out the 'Contact me' page to send a message.<BR><BR>June has now been added to the archive.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
