<P>October 29&#44; 2000</P><P>Jonathan has become the 14th member to join the ISW and he has his own web-page. This will be put into the links page ASAP. If you can't wait that long then <A CLASS="news" HREF="http://www.starwars.20m.com" TARGET="_blank">click here</A>.<BR><BR>The 'under construction' page has been changed to tie in more with the site. If you rememer it had a small picture of a stop sign. Well now our little friend has a nice message for us. <A CLASS="news" HREF="404.html">Click here</A>.<BR><BR>"Higher Ground" which stars Hayden Christensen can now be seen on Irish television. It is on every Saturday at 5.00 PM on RTE 1. It's interesting to watch him in action.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>October 27&#44; 2000</P><P>Three new members joined the ISW this week. Welcome to Rob Dalton, Sparky and of course you all know PhantomShadow. This now makes 13 members in the ISW.<BR><BR>Last weeks Irish Times magazine has a small article in it about the  "11th Annual Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Horror Convention" which took place in Dublin last week. There were a number of writers that went to the convention but I could not see any Star Wars writers. If anyone went to the convention <A CLASS="news" HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">tell us what you thought</A>. More information ca be found at <A CLASS="news" HREF="http://www.octocon.com" TARGET="_blank">www.octocon.com</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>October 22&#44; 2000</P><P>For the first time PhantomShadow has not won the Trivia competition, he was beaten by Ian Motter who entered the competition before PhantomShadow. Congratulations to him. Jade wins the Gold members award and its another silver for Mike. Congratulations to both of you.<BR>Trivia Set IV is now up, closing date is the 4th of November.<BR><BR>In other updates, there is a new Editorials page instead of the old 'under construction' page. Along with this there is a new contact address. If you want to submit an Editorial send it to this address:<BR><A CLASS="news" HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">star-wars-ed@iol.ie</A></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>October 21&#44; 2000</P><P>Jade has recently joined the ISW bringing its membership to 10. Welcome Jade.<BR><BR>Andrea Swinco has recently e-mailed me with information on a Star Wars convention taking place in England on the 26th of November. To read a copy of the report <A CLASS="news" HREF="convention.html" TARGET="_blank">click here</A>. It sounds like a good day out.<BR><BR>The computer magazine "Computer and Video Games (<A CLASS="news" HREF="http://www.computerandvideogames.com" TARGET="_blank">www.computerandvideogames.com</A>) recently pitted Star Wars games against Star Trek games. Here was the result:<BLOCKQUOTE>Both have gaming skeletons in their cupboards, but the number - and sheer badness - of the Wars turkeys almost swayed it. That said, the best of the Wars games are better than the best of Trek, making for no obvious winner.</BLOCKQUOTE>Well I know who my winner is anyway.<BR><BR>The results of this weeks poll are also in, check it out on the polls page. This weeks poll ties in with the above report. It may be a bit biasd to put it on a Star Wars only site but it would be interestiong to see if anyone would vote for Star Trek.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>October 14&#44; 2000</P><P>Unfortunatly I had a bit of trouble with the HTML of the page last week, that was why the site couldn't be viewed (well I couldn't see it anyway). Because of this the Trivia will be allowed to continue for another week. Updates to the site this week include a new <A CLASS="news" HREF="contact.html">contact page</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>October 8&#44; 2000</P><P>Three more people have now joined the ISW bringing our total up to nine members. Welcome to Balzacamadeus, Niamh and Ger. Don't forget to vote in the poll and take part in the Trivia competition.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>October 7&#44; 2000</P>This week the Backchat section of the RTE guide (dated October 7 - 13, 2000) has this to say:

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Website of the week: </B><A CLASS="news" HREF="http://www.starwars.com" TARGET="_blank">www.starwars.com</A> is the place to be for the first sneak preview of the next George Lucas space opera. Check it out.</BLOCKQUOTE>I guess the build up for Episode II is beginning here in Ireland too. Will we be able to hold out for another two years?<BR>There is a new poll up in the polls section. It ties in with <A CLASS="news" HREF="http://cgi.theforce.net/theforce/tfn.cgi?storyID=8000" TARGET="_blank">this report on theforce.net</A> in which the 'One world, one release' petition is to be handed to Lucasfilm. I want to know what your opinion is.<BR>Also don't forget about the Trivia and spread the word around about the site.<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>October 1&#44; 2000</P><P>Well the ISW is nearly two months old now, and I'm glad to say has gone from strength to strength. I never imagined that anybody would join, never mind six people. I just hope that all our good work will continue. You never know if we last until 2002 we could all go and see Episode II together. But that is all for the future, meanwhile, the <A CLASS="news" HREF="archive_news.html">news archives</A> have been updated to include <A CLASS="news" HREF="arc_09-00.html">September 2000</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
