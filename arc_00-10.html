            <p>Three new members joined the ISW this week. Welcome to Rob Dalton, Sparky and of course you all know
                PhantomShadow. This now makes 13 members in the ISW.<br><br>Last weeks Irish Times magazine has a small
                article in it about the "11th Annual Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Horror Convention" which took place in Dublin
                last
                week. There were a number of writers that went to the convention but I could not see any Star Wars
                writers.
                If anyone went to the convention <a href="contact.html">tell us what you
                    thought</a>. More information can be found at <a href="https://www.octocon.com"

            <p>For the first time PhantomShadow has not won the Trivia competition, he was beaten by Ian Motter who
                entered
                the competition before PhantomShadow. Congratulations to him. Jade wins the Gold members award and its
                another silver for Mike. Congratulations to both of you.<br>Trivia Set IV is now up, closing date is the
                4th
                of November.<br><br>In other updates, there is a new Editorials page instead of the old 'under
                construction'
                page. Along with this there is a new contact address. If you want to submit an Editorial send it to this

            <p>Jade has recently joined the ISW bringing its membership to 10. Welcome Jade.<br><br>Andrea Swinco has
                recently e-mailed me with information on a Star Wars convention taking place in England on the 26th of
                November. To read a copy of the report <a href="404.html">click
                    here</a>. It sounds like a good day out.<br><br>The computer magazine "Computer and Video Games (<a

                recently
                pitted Star Wars games against Star Trek
                games. Here was the result:
            <blockquote>Both have gaming skeletons in their cupboards, but the number - and sheer badness - of the Wars
                turkeys almost swayed it. That said, the best of the Wars games are better than the best of Trek, making
                for
                no obvious winner.</blockquote>Well I know who my winner is anyway.<br><br>The results of this weeks
            poll
            are also in, check it out on the polls page. This weeks poll ties in with the above report. It may be a bit
            biasd to put it on a Star Wars only site but it would be interestiong to see if anyone would vote for Star
            Trek.

            <h1>October 14, 2000</h1>
            <p>Unfortunatly I had a bit of trouble with the HTML of the page last week, that was why the site couldn't
                be
                viewed (well I couldn't see it anyway). Because of this the Trivia will be allowed to continue for
                another
                week. Updates to the site this week include a new <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>

            <p>This week the Backchat section of the RTÉ guide (dated October 7 - 13, 2000) has this to
                say:
                <br>
            <blockquote><b>Website of the week: </b><a href="https://www.starwars.com"
                    target="_blank">www.starwars.com</a>
                is the place to be for the first sneak preview of the next George
                Lucas space opera. Check it out.</blockquote>I guess the build up for Episode II is beginning here in
            Ireland too. Will we be able to hold out for another two years?<br>There is a new poll up in the polls
            section.
            It ties in with <a href="https://cgi.theforce.net/theforce/tfn.cgi?storyID=8000" target="_blank">this report
                on
                theforce.net</a> in which the 'One world, one release' petition is to be
            handed to Lucasfilm. I want to know what your opinion is.<br>Also don't forget about the Trivia and spread
            the
            word around about the site.

            <p>Well the ISW is nearly two months old now, and I'm glad to say has gone from strength to strength. I
                never
                imagined that anybody would join, never mind six people. I just hope that all our good work will
                continue.
                You never know if we last until 2002 we could all go and see Episode II together. But that is all for
                the
                future, meanwhile, the <a href="archive_news.html">news archives</a> have been updated to
                include <a href="arc_09-00.html">September 2000</a>.</p>
