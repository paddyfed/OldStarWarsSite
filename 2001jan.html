To see a scan of the full article, click <A HREF="liam_neeson_article1.jpg" class="news">here</A> and <A HREF="liam_neeson_article2.jpg" class="news">here</A>. Also last night Stephen Spielberg's "Schindler's List" was on starring Liam.<BR><BR>I like to see the activity in the message forum these days. I am also thinking (and looking) for a chat program so that we will be able to 'talk' to each other. If you see any <a href="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie" class="news">mail me</a> or go to the forum.<BR><BR>This week we also have a new member, welcome to Liones.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>January 20&#44; 2001</P><P>Recently Rob Hoitt recieved a plot synopsis for Episode II. As he says he doesn't know how legit his source is so don't take this in any way to be cannon. As to what I think, I don't believe that this will be exactly how the film will pan out but there may be bits of truth in some areas. Definatly read this with a pinch of salt. (May be some spoiler material). <A HREF="spoiler.txt" class="news">Click here</A>.<BR><BR>We have reached the magic 1000 visitors to the site. This is a mignificant achievement ad I'd like to thank all of you who have come along to the site. The results of the last poll are in the previous polls section.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>January 13&#44; 2001</P><P>We have two new members in the club, welcome to both Rob Hoitt and Seamus McQuaid.<BR><BR>Jade gives us her own <A HREF="ed.html" class="news">editorial</A> all about her experiences at Star Wars conventions in Pennsylvania. The editorial can also be found at her own site <A HREF="http://www.friendsintheforce.com" TARGET="_blank" class="news">"Friends in the Force"</A>. If you want to reply to this or any other Editorial send an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:star-wars-ed@iol.ie" class="news">star-wars-ed@iol.ie</A></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>January 6&#44; 2001</P><P>Well January 6th is the traditional day for taking down the decorations so this is also true for the ISW. But rather than go back to the old design I decided to make a fresh design for the new year. With this redesign I have also improved the site so that it will be easier to update in the future (well I think so anyway :P). The most noticable change will be the poll appearing on the main page. This is to encourage visitors to take part. If you scroll down the page you will also see links to Episode II select and on location. Also there is a link to the fabulous interactive Star Wars galaxy which is hosted by <A HREF="http://www.galacticempire.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">GalacticEmpire.net</A>. If you havent seen it yet then I highly recommend it.<BR><BR>In other updates, Tipplehilti has offered us his own opinion on the DVD situation and it can be viewed <A HREF="ed_1.html" class="news">here</A>. There is also a new poll up as you can see.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>January 3&#44; 2001</P><P>Well I've finished my editorial entitled <A href="ed.html" class="news">'Patience is a virtue'</A>. I hope that you like it and that you will give your reply either via the forum or trough <a href="mailto:star-wars-ed@iol.ie" class="news">e-mail</A>. If you have your own editorial then <a href="mailto:star-wars-ed@iol.ie" class="news">submit it</A> to me.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>January 1&#44; 2001</P><P>Happy new year everybody! I hope you had a good one. As for me, it was a quiet one. The news archives have been updated to include December 2000.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
