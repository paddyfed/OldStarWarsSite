            <p>Sarah Harris has become the newest member of the ISW, welcome to her.<br><br>Looking through my e-mail
                inbox
                I realised that I do have a lot of URL's for other Star Wars fan clubs. I hope to put these together
                either
                this week or next.<br><br>As reported in <a href="https://www.theforce.net"
                    target="_blank">TheForce.net</a>
                apparently there were a few Stormtroopers in today's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Unfortunatly I didn't see
                it
                but if anyone did then perhaps you could give us <a href="contact.html">some more
                    details</a>.<br><br>I realise that there have been a few connectivity problems lately. Unfortunatly
                this
                is out of my control and has something to do with <a href="404.html">IOL</a>,
                my
                ISP.</p>

            <p>Sorry about the lack of updates recently. As you can tell the Star Wars convention "JediCon UK" is over.
                I
                hope that all who travelled to the event had a good time. Perhaps they could also tell us about the day.
                Also if anyone hears of another convention please <a href="contact.html">mail
                    me</a>.<br><br>I
                recently read the messages in the guestbook something that I havent done in a while. I'd just like to
                thank
                all those who did sign it and ask others to do likewise. It can be found on the <a
                    href="index.html">main page</a>.<br><br>Due to a post on the register I hope to add a new section to
                the
                links page with links to international Star Wars fan sites. If you kow of any send the URL to me.</p>
