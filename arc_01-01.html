            <h1>January 20, 2001</h1>
            <p>Recently Rob Hoitt recieved a plot synopsis for Episode II. As he says he doesn't know how legit his source
                is so don't take this in any way to be cannon. As to what I think, I don't believe that this will be exactly
                how the film will pan out but there may be bits of truth in some areas. Definatly read this with a pinch of
                salt. (May be some spoiler material). <a href="spoiler.txt">Click here</a>.<br><br>We have reached the magic
                1000 visitors to the site. This is a mignificant achievement ad I'd like to thank all of you who have come
                along to the site. The results of the last poll are in the previous polls section.</p>

            <h1>January 6, 2001</h1>
            <p>Well January 6th is the traditional day for taking down the decorations so this is also true for the ISW. But
                rather than go back to the old design I decided to make a fresh design for the new year. With this redesign
                I have also improved the site so that it will be easier to update in the future (well I think so anyway :P).
                The most noticable change will be the poll appearing on the main page. This is to encourage visitors to take
                part. If you scroll down the page you will also see links to Episode II select and on location. Also there
                is a link to the fabulous interactive Star Wars galaxy which is hosted by <a
                    href="https://www.galacticempire.net" target="_blank">GalacticEmpire.net</a>. If you havent seen it yet
                then I highly recommend it.<br><br>In other updates, Tipplehilti has offered us his own opinion on the DVD
                situation and it can be viewed <a href="ed_1.html">here</a>. There is also a new poll up as you can see.</p>

            <h1>January 3, 2001</h1>

                like it and that you will give your reply either via the forum or trough <a
                    href="mailto:star-wars-ed@iol.ie">e-mail</a>. If you have your own editorial then <a

            <p>Happy new year everybody! I hope you had a good one. As for me, it was a quiet one. The news archives have
                been updated to include December 2000.</p>
