<P>June 14, 2002</P><P>Because of the recent closure of Galactic Empire UK I've had to re-arrange a few things. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my great sadness at the closure of this site. It was definatly one of my favourites and have visited it since the beginning. Thanks to Palps for the many years of fun, features and support.<BR><BR>I've written a new editorial (yes I know its been almost a year since the last one) about my journey to go and see Episode II. Please feel free to <A HREF="edit_05.html">read and reply</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>June 7, 2002</P><P>I've opened a new section dedicated to the RT� Guide articles that I have scanned. There aren't many in there at the moment but I have a few old articles for Episode I that I have yet to scan. Anyway check it out <A HREF="rteguide.html">here</A> for now. I'll have a link to the left up soon.<BR><BR>We have a new member, say hello to Nero.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>June 1, 2002</P><P>Steve Boyle has asked me to inform you of a project that he is starting over on his website. This is what he has to say.<BLOCKQUOTE>I run an online fan project called Dark Genesis. So far we have created a novel and are working on a comic book adaptation and 3d movie. Recently I was thinking about doing a live action version of the story. So, I'm looking for like minded irish people to help out.</BLOCKQUOTE>If you feel you could give him a hand in any way or need a bit more information, head over to <A HREF="https://darkgenesis.8m.com" TARGET="_blank">his site</A>.<BR><BR>May 2002 has been added to the archives.<BR><BR>Some of you may remember that I was disappointed that the RT� guide did not have a countdown to Episode II like they did for Episode I. However they have more than made up for it in the past few weeks with loads of articles about the movie. I hope to have them scanned for you soon.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
