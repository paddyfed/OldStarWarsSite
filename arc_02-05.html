            <p>Well I've seen Episode II now 5 times and it gets better with each viewing. I don't know if I'll see it again
                before the video comes out. Maybe if I go with someone who hasn't seen it yet.<br><br><a
                    href="https://www.evilgerald.com" target="_blank">The Evil Gerald</a> has an article about Episode II.
                It's quite funny, the headline is: Triumph for Lucas as new Star Wars film hailed as "not shit". Read it <a
                    href="https://www.evilgerald.com/Issues/Issue21/4starwars.htm" target="_blank">here</a><br><br>We have a
                new member to the ISW as well, Exar Kun has added his name to the list.</p>

            <p>Finally it's here. Episode II is out in cinemas all over the world. Yes I've seen it and yes I think it's
                great. Hopefully I will tell you all about what I think soon.<br><br>A new poll is up. I've decided not to
                have any user suggestions or comments because some people have decided to abuse this system. I'm not
                entirely surprised but still disappointed.</p>

            <p>I'm very sorry about the long delay in updating the site. My computer was ravaged by a virus recently which
                brought it down to a slow crawl. If the virus accidently got onto your computer (which is likely) I suggest
                you go to <a href="https://www.antivirus.com" target="_blank">www.antivirus.com</a> and check out your
                computer. The virus I had was WORM_KLEZ.H and I'm sorry if I gave it to you.<br><br>Anyway back to the more
                exciting stuff 5 DAYS LEFT until EPISODE II!!! I honestly can't wait but it seems that I wont be able to see
                it until the 17th. My local cinema (Letterkenny) won't have it in until then. But I think I can stand it,
                I've waited this long already.<br><br>This weeks RTÃ‰ guide (May 11 - 17) has a small article on Episode II.
                Click <a href="rteguide_aotc1.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="rteguide_aotc2.jpg"
                    target="_blank">here</a> to view it. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't run a countdown to
                Episode II like they did for Episode I but anyway.<br><br>The Star Dudes saga is also continuing. A trailer
                for The Phantom Dude is now up on <a href="https://theforce.net/theater/comingsoon/phantomdude/index.shtml"
