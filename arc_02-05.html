<P>May 29, 2002</P><P>Well I've seen Episode II now 5 times and it gets better with each viewing. I don't know if I'll see it again before the video comes out. Maybe if I go with someone who hasn't seen it yet.<br><br><a href="http://www.evilgerald.com" target="_blank">The Evil Gerald</a> has an article about Episode II. It's quite funny, the headline is: Triumph for Lucas as new Star Wars film hailed as "not shit". Read it <a href="http://www.evilgerald.com/Issues/Issue21/4starwars.htm" target="_blank">here</a><br><br>We have a new member to the ISW as well, Exar Kun has added his name to the list.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>May 18, 2002</P><P>Finally it's here. Episode II is out in cinemas all over the world. Yes I've seen it and yes I think it's great. Hopefully I will tell you all about what I think soon.<BR><BR>A new poll is up. I've decided not to have any user suggestions or comments because some people have decided to abuse this system. I'm not entirely surprised but still disappointed.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>May 11, 2002</P><P>I'm very sorry about the long delay in updating the site. My computer was ravaged by a virus recently which brought it down to a slow crawl. If the virus accidently got onto your computer (which is likely) I suggest you go to <A HREF="http://www.antivirus.com" TARGET="_blank">www.antivirus.com</A> and check out your computer. The virus I had was WORM_KLEZ.H and I'm sorry if I gave it to you.<BR><BR>Anyway back to the more exciting stuff 5 DAYS LEFT until EPISODE II!!! I honestly can't wait but it seems that I wont be able to see it until the 17th. My local cinema (Letterkenny) won't have it in until then. But I think I can stand it, I've waited this long already.<BR><BR>This weeks RTÈ guide (May 11 - 17) has a small article on Episode II. Click <A HREF="rteguide_aotc1.jpg" TARGET="_blank">here</A> and <A HREF="rteguide_aotc2.jpg" TARGET="_blank">here</A> to view it. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't run a countdown to Episode II like they did for Episode I but anyway.<BR><BR>The Star Dudes saga is also continuing. A trailer for The Phantom Dude is now up on <A HREF="http://theforce.net/theater/comingsoon/phantomdude/index.shtml" TARGET="_blank">TheForce.net</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
