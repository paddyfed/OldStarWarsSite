<P>March 31&#44; 2001</P><P>Steve Boyle has become the 21st member of the ISW and the first to join since January 2001. Welcome to him.<BR><BR>As its the last day in March the archives will be added to. Also I want to expand the links section of the site so if you have any links that you wish to have added then <A HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie" class="news">mail me</A>.<BR><BR>A new poll is up on the main page also. If you have any questions that you believe would make a good poll then <A HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie" class="news">mail me</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>March24&#44; 2001</P><P>Well St. Patrick's week-end is well and truly over. I hope you enjoyed it wherever you were.<BR><BR>I got an e-mail from Collect World Events telling me of a Star Wars convention 'Jedicon' taking place over in England on the 22nd of April. <A HREF="swcon.html" TARGET="_blank" class="news">Click here</A> to find out more or visit the <A HREF="http://www.scifishows.com" TARGET="_blank" class="news">'Jedicon' site</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>March 10&#44; 2001</P><P>As I'm not sure where I'll be on St Patrick's Day this year I have decided to put up the 'decorations' a week early. So if I don't update next week (17th March) Happy St. Patrick's Day.<BR><BR>I would also like to warn those from the Republic who may be thinking of subscribing to the official Star Wars magazine that you need to pay in pounds Sterling not in Punts. I've learned  this the hard way and I hope I've prevented someone from making the same mistake.<BR><BR>With the recent 'announcement' on <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">TheForce.net</A> that Episode II may be released worldwide at the same time that would make the countdown on the site wrong. However I have decided to keep it as it is until there is official word from Lucasfilm. The article can be found on <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net/episode2" TARGET="_blank" class="news">TheForce.net's Episode II</A> page.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>March 3&#44; 2001</P><P>The archives have been added to include February 2001. I am also looking to restart the Trivia competitions but I don't have the time (or patience) to make up and correct questions. If any visitor or member of the site thinks that they will be able to do this please <A HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie" class="news">e-mail me</A>.<BR><BR>There is also a new poll on the site and the results of the last poll have been recorded.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
