<P>September 29&#44; 2000</P><P>I have to apologise for not having any updates last week, I did have everything typed up and ready for posting but I forgot to upload it. Sorry about that, the updates from last week are below. Because of this minor slip-up there are no other updates this week.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>September 24&#44; 2000</P><P>The results of Trivia set II are now in with another win for PhantomShadow. Tipple Hilti wins the gold award. Mike Farnham was the only other member to enter the competition so he gets the silver award. Trivia set III is now up. Also the results of the poll are up on the <A CLASS="news" HREF="poll.html" target="iswpoll">polls page.</A>I am now accepting editorials to go into an editorial section of the site. As I've said before it doesnt have to be anything special, just something about Star Wars. <A CLASS="news" HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">e-mail me</A> with your entries.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>September 17&#44; 2000</P><P>Mike Farnham has become the sixth member of the ISW. Welcome Mike, I hope you will be happy here. The result of the poll is in with a large support for the editorial section of the site. I don't mind having an editorial section as long as some people contribute to it. The full results are in the <A CLASS="news" HREF="poll.html" target="iswpoll">poll section</A>. A new poll is also up, please check it out. In other news, I am starting college tomorrow (Monday) and unless I can get access to this site, updates will have to be on a weekly baisis. All this will mean is that the updates will be less frequent but larger (I hope). If this changes I will of course let you know.</P><p align="center"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></p>
<P>September 14&#44; 2000</P><P>Sorry about the lack of updates, but I have been quite busy recently. Anyway, the results of the trivia are in and unfortunatly we only got 4 entries. I have concluded that you actually don't want a trivia competition of this kind so I am looking into a new format for the quiz. With this in mind, <A CLASS="news" HREF="trivia.html">Trivia Set II</A> is now up with only 3 questions. The winner will be picked first on right answers, then by the order in which they were recieved by me (first one in is a winner). PhantomShadow is the winner of trivia set I with 22 points, if you are a reader of alt.fan.starwars then you will know who this is. Well done to him. Tipplehilti was the only member to enter the trivia so he gets the gold award.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>September 10&#44; 2000</P><P>No updates this time, just a status report of sorts. I havve found a Message board but I don't believe it is the right one for us. It is from freepolls but it isn't a great board, bad format for a MB. If you find any other free message board providers, please tell me. The same goes for a chat room. However if we do not find a chat room we could use IRC, but we will wait and see. Contact me also if you want to place your own editorial on the site. You could write on any aspect of Star Wars or even give an Irish spin on the subject. They don't have to be long, just a few paragraphs, nor does it have to be a masterpiece of writing. Just something simple.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>September 6&#44; 2000</P><P>Not much of an update this time, just wanted to let you know that there will be regular polls on the site. These will be put up on the <A CLASS="news" HREF="poll.html" target="iswpoll">polls section</A> of the site along with the results. Most polls will last about a week with two weeks being the maximum. I will try to put up questions that will be of general interest about Star Wars so that everyone will have some sort of opinion or some input to make. There is only 6 days left to enter the <A CLASS="news" HREF="trivia.html">trivia competition.</A> I have to say that I'm disappointed at the amount of entries that I have received. If I don't get at least five more by the 12th then this will be the first and last trivia competition.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>September 2&#44; 2000</P><P>Well here is the poll that I was talking about. It will be up for about two weeks, maybe less, so get your vote in now. Any visitor  to the site may vote.<BR>I recently have had a bit of 'place foot in mouth' disease recently. Not only did I get Sabb's e-mail address in the members section wrong but I also made a mistake in calling Sabb a him when she joined. She has recently corrected me and I would like to say 'sorry'  to her for the mistake :).</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>September 1&#44; 2000</P><P>Well&#44; the club and this site has almost been online for a month now and with this I announce the opening of the Archives&#46; These will hold all news from the club on a monthly baisis begining with August 2000&#46; For now it won&#39;t be that interesting but you may look back on it with nostalga sometime in the future&#46; Also with this you may notice that the pages have been slightly redesigned, this is to help with navigation through the site. The Index page, or welcome page, has also had a redesign with the addition of a new guestbook for the site so you can all show your appreciation :). I will soon be putting up a poll on the site which should indicate to me what section you would like to see most in the site. These have been suggested by Tipplehilti. If you have any suggestions yourself, <A CLASS="news" HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie">e-mail me.</A></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
