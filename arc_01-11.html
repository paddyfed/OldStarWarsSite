            <p>The changeover to Version 3 continues. This time all the old editorials have been transferred. Also my home
                computer has been fixed and I'm in the process of transferring files to it.</p>

            <p>Trailer C 'Forbidden Love' is now up on the <a href="https://www.starwars.com"
                    target="_blank">StarWars.com</a> site and I have to say that it gives me that tingly feeling which is
                good. I've also seen the other trailer, Trailer B 'Mystery', and it looks great too. I especially loved the
                last few lines.</p>

            <h1>November 13, 2001</h1>
            <p>Episode II release date confirmed, Thursday 16th May is the day everyone gets off work and camps out at the
                local cinema. I guess the 'One world, One release campaign' was heard by someone. Not only that but the
                teaser poster was officially announced as well. I think it would have looked better without the saber
                though.<BR><BR>On a completly different note, you may or may not know of the Blackout Ireland campaign that
                is taking place on Friday and I have decided to join in by taking down my two sites, this one and <a
                    href="https://www.geocities.com/paddyfedoo" target="_blank">PaddyFedoo Online</a>, offline for the day.
                For more information on the campaign go to <a href="https://blackout.irelandoffline.org"
                    target="_blank">blackout.irelandoffline.org</a>. Also the news archives for October have been added.</p>

            <h1>November 8, 2001</h1>
            <p>Well I've seen the Episode II trailer and I think it looks brilliant! TV3 did show the trailer, as reported
                on TheForce.net but it was a day later than BBC and they didn't show it in full which really ruined it.</p>
