<P>November 21&#44; 2001</P><P>The changeover to Version 3 continues. This time all the old editorials have been transferred. Also my home computer has been fixed and I'm in the process of transferring files to it.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 17&#44; 2001</P><P>Trailer C 'Forbidden Love' is now up on the <A HREF="http://www.starwars.com" TARGET="_blank">StarWars.com</A> site and I have to say that it gives me that tingly feeling which is good. I've also seen the other trailer, Trailer B 'Mystery', and it looks great too. I especially loved the last few lines.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 13&#44; 2001</P><P>Episode II release date confirmed, Thursday 16th May is the day everyone gets off work and camps out at the local cinema. I guess the 'One world, One release campaign' was heard by someone. Not only that but the teaser poster was officially announced as well. I think it would have looked better without the saber though.<BR><BR>On a completly different note, you may or may not know of the Blackout Ireland campaign that is taking place on Friday and I have decided to join in by taking down my two sites, this one and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/paddyfedoo" target="_blank">PaddyFedoo Online</a>, offline for the day. For more information on the campaign go to <a href="http://blackout.irelandoffline.org" target="_blank">blackout.irelandoffline.org</a>. Also the news archives for October have been added.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>November 8&#44; 2001</P><P>Well I've seen the Episode II trailer and I think it looks brilliant! TV3 did show the trailer, as reported on TheForce.net but it was a day later than BBC and they didn't show it in full which really ruined it.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
