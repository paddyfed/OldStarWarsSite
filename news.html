<!--<P>October 9&#44; 2001</P><P>Still having computer problems at home but I hope they will be fixed by the end of the week.<br><br>Because of the problems, things here have pretty much come to a standstill with work on Version 3 practically stopped. But as always our affiliate <a href="http://www.galacticempire.net" target="_blank" class="news">GalacticEmpire.net</a> is at hand for all your Star Wars needs.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>October 2&#44; 2001</P><P>I've had a bit of a crisis at home. My hard-drive has crashed and I can do nothing with my computer. It is currently being formatted. Sorry about the inconvenience.<br><br>I haven't updated the archives yet because of the problem and if there are any applications sent to me I won't recieve them until the computer is fixed.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>September 25&#44; 2001</P><P>I know it's been ages since I've updated the site and I apologise but Star Wars and most everything else has taken a back seat recently. I think you'll agree. I have also started back at college and my time is pressed. However I am working away at a new design for the site. Something which I hope you will like. So don't expect too many updates in the recent days & weeks.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>

<P>September 4&#44; 2001</P><P>August has come and gone and Star Wars news continues. However no news on the Irish side though. I recently got the UK Star Wars magazine and it said that the Episode I DVD will be about £25 Stirling which equates to about £30 Punt or &#8364;40 euro (see I'm doing my bit :P). News archives have been added to and I'm working on something special for the site that should be ready soon (I hope).</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>August 26&#44; 2001</P><P><a href="filmfest_big.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="filmfest_sml.jpg" width="125" height="120" border="1" align="right" alt="A Familiar Character"></a>Last thursday, 23 August, the Northern-Irish newspaper, <A HREF="http://www.irishnews.com" TARGET="_blank" class="news">The Irish News</A>, caried an article about the Belfast Film Festival which started on Wednesday. Here is an excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE>Science fiction will be brought down to earth with a futuristic look at Belfast in the year 3001, as well as sci-fi offerings from cult directors George Lucas and Stanly Kubrick.</BLOCKQUOTE>Pretty cool. As well as this they had a familiar character on the streets of Belfast launching the festival. For a scan of the full article <A HREF="filmfest_article.jpg" TARGET="_blank" class="news">click here</A>.<BR><BR>There is a new poll up and the results of the last poll have been archived. The results are interesting, the majority of visitors to the site that participated don't mind the new Episode II title. <A HREF="poll_res.html" TARGET="_blank" class="news">View the results</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>August 21&#44; 2001</P><P>Sorry for no recent updates. I've just come back from my holiday to Tenerife. I had a great time and I hope to tell you all about it soon :P<BR><BR>A new member has joined the ISW, the first since our first birthday. Welcome to Eamonn Reilly.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>August 8&#44; 2001</P><P>Well, what a time to have our birthday celebrations. Big announcements have been made in the Star Wars world. The title for Episode II has been officially announced as 'Attack of the Clones'. Many people hate the title, saying it's too cheesy or sounds too much like 'clowns'. I, myself, like the title and don't have a problem with it. <A HREF="cont.html" class="news">What do you think?</A><BR><BR>There's a new poll up. I know it's very similar to the poll on <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">TheForce.net</A>, but I'm interested in the opinions of the visitors to this site.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>August 2&#44; 2001</P><P>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE ISW!!! On this day, exactly 1 year ago, I created this website for all Irish Star Wars fans. In that time we have had over 1400 visitors and 26 members joined the group. I'd like to thank everyone who has shown support for the club and all the visitors and members. Lets hope we are here for another year.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 31&#44; 2001</P><P>I was going to put the pop-up ads on the site this week but judging by the response to the latest poll I think I'll wait awhile. However I do want peoples opinions. If we don't have the pop-up ads, why not and are there any other alternatives?<BR><BR>The site has also had a few changes in the background which should ensure faster loading (I hope).<BR><BR>July 2001 has been added to the archives.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 22&#44; 2001</P><P>I have recieved a new application for membership of the ISW however, I am skeptical of the authenticity of the applicant. However I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Welcome to Euan McGregor to the ISW.<BR><BR>The ISW Chat Room is now open. You don't have to register to use the chat room and it's completly free. Please check it out and tell me what you think.<BR><BR>A new poll has been set and the previous poll results have been recorded.<BR><BR>Trivia set VI is now open and to celebrate our affiliation with GalacticEmpire.net it is a special Trivia set all about the website.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 12&#44; 2001</P><P>Sorry about the rude alert but this editorial is very important and I want everyone to read it. The poll has been moved to a different page because it was getting too cluttered on the page.<BR><BR>We have now been affiliated with <A HREF="http://www.galacticempire.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">The Galactic Empire Network</A> run by Palpatine. I have always believed that this was an inevitable affiliation seeing as we use some of the features from the site. In celebration of this I will be dedicating our sixth Trivia competition to the site.<BR><BR>If you read the notice on GEN about our affiliation you will see that Palpatine uses my real name and perhaps it is time that I stopped hiding behind this anon. name (ISW Admin) and used my own. My name is Patrick but my friends call me Paddy and I've been a serious fan of Star Wars ever since I got the videos in 1995. I live in Co. Monaghan in Ireland and I go to college in Letterkenny. Recently I have started building a <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/paddyfedoo" TARGET="_blank" class="news">site for myself</A> but it's pretty empty at the minute. I like to use my online persona, PaddyFedoo, for posting to newsgroups and chat-rooms.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 10&#44; 2001</P><P>The requests page is now open. I hope you will all view it and see what type of service that it is. I hope that this will be a regular feature and that I won't have to abandon it after a week :). <BR><BR>As you can see, yes I do have plans to introduce a chat section very soon. Keep your eye out for that.<BR><BR>I have also managed to scrape togeher a few trivia questions so I hope to be restarting that. I hope our 3 times champion, PhantomShadow, is ready to defend his title.<BR><BR>I also have some more important updates and announcements soon so please keep in touch.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>July 2&#44; 2001</P><P>Thanks to those who tested out the message service. It seems to be working just fine. Check out the 'Contact me' page to send a message.<BR><BR>June has now been added to the archive.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>June 30&#44; 2001</P><P>If you look at the '<A HREF="cont.html" class="news">Contact Me</A>' section you will find a new form which (hopefully) enables those with web-mail to send messages directly to me. I'm not sure how well it is working so I would appreciate if you could test it out by sending a few messages.<BR><BR>I hope to have the 'Requests' page up and running as soon as possible. When that happens I hope to have a full explanation of the section.<BR><BR>I think I may have found a chat program for the site. As of yet I haven't checked it out fully so nothing final yet.<BR><BR>I was sent a link via e-mail from the author of an edited version of Episode I. No not THE Phantom Edit, just a different version. This is what the author had to say:<BLOCKQUOTE>Imagine...<BR>No Jar Jar. More Qui-gon/Obi-wan interaction. More Yoda. <BR>Midichlorians? What Midichlorians? It is no longer a dream.<BR><BR>the Jar Jar-free rewrite of Episode I <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/dc/script/index.html" TARGET="_blank" class="news">www.angelfire.com/dc/script/index.html</A><BR><BR>spread the word.</BLOCKQUOTE>Well, I've read some of it and I don't think much of it. However I'll let you make up your own mind.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
