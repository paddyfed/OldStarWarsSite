                        alt="A Familiar Character"></a>Last thursday, 23 August, the Northern-Irish newspaper, <a
                    href="https://www.irishnews.com" target="_blank">The Irish News</a>, caried an article about the Belfast
                Film Festival which started on Wednesday. Here is an excerpt:
            <blockquote>Science fiction will be brought down to earth with a futuristic look at Belfast in the year 3001, as
                well as sci-fi offerings from cult directors George Lucas and Stanly Kubrick.</blockquote>Pretty cool. As
            well as this they had a familiar character on the streets of Belfast launching the festival. For a scan of the
            full article <a href="filmfest_article.jpg" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br><br>There is a new poll up and
            the results of the last poll have been archived. The results are interesting, the majority of visitors to the
            site that participated don't mind the new Episode II title. <a href="poll_res.html" target="_blank">View the

            <p>Sorry for no recent updates. I've just come back from my holiday to Tenerife. I had a great time and I hope

            <p>Well, what a time to have our birthday celebrations. Big announcements have been made in the Star Wars world.
                The title for Episode II has been officially announced as 'Attack of the Clones'. Many people hate the
                title, saying it's too cheesy or sounds too much like 'clowns'. I, myself, like the title and don't have a
                problem with it. <a href="contact.html">What do you think?</a><br><br>There's a new poll up. I know it's very
                similar to the poll on <a href="https://www.theforce.net" target="_blank">TheForce.net</a>, but I'm
                interested in the opinions of the visitors to this site.</p>

                everyone who has shown support for the club and all the visitors and members. Lets hope we are here for
                another year.</p>
