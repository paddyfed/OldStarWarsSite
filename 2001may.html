<P>May 20&#44; 2001</P><P>Sarah Harris has become the newest member of the ISW, welcome to her.<BR><BR>Looking through my e-mail inbox I realised that I do have a lot of URL's for other Star Wars fan clubs. I hope to put these together either this week or next.<BR><BR>As reported in <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">TheForce.net</A> apparently there were a few Stormtroopers in today's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Unfortunatly I didn't see it but if anyone did then perhaps you could give us <A HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie" class="news">some more details</A>.<BR><BR>I realise that there have been a few connectivity problems lately. Unfortunatly this is out of my control and has something to do with <A HREF="http://www.iol.ie" TARGET="_blank" class="news">IOL</A>, my ISP.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>May 13&#44; 2001</P><P>Sorry about the lack of updates recently. As you can tell the Star Wars convention "JediCon UK" is over. I hope that all who travelled to the event had a good time. Perhaps they could also tell us about the day. Also if anyone hears of another convention please <A HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie" class="news">mail me</A>.<BR><BR>I recently read the messages in the guestbook something that I havent done in a while. I'd just like to thank all those who did sign it and ask others to do likewise. It can be found o the <A HREF="index.html" TARGET="_parent" class="news">main page</A>.<BR><BR>Due to a post on the register I hope to add a new section to the links page with links to international Star Wars fan sites. If you kow of any send the URL to me.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
