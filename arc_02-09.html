            <h1>September 22, 2002</h1>
            <p>Ok I know I'm a week late with the updates but College has just started again & I didn't get a chance. If I
                have a bit of time during the week I'll be able to update but don't count on it.<br><br>The results of the
                last Trivia competition are up. Well done to Gabriel for getting his first gold. This months competition is
                also up, get your answers in quickly.</p>

            <h1>September 4, 2002</h1>
            <p>You probably didn't realise but last week I was away on holidays which is the reason for the lack of updates.
                I did have an article to scan from The Irish Times about Liam Neesons unveiling of the Michael Collins
                statue. Rest assured if I find it I'll upload it.<br><br>The news archives have been added to include
                August.<br><br>Welcome new members Nick Murdoch and Maz who both joined in August but I didn't get round to
                adding them.</p>
