            <h1>November 24, 2002</h1>
            <p>I was finally able to scan an article from the RTÉ Guide this week. It's only a small one about Ewan
                McGregor. See it <a href="rteguide_ewanart.jpg">here</a> and the photo is <a
                    href="rteguide_ewanpic.jpg">here</a>.<br><br>The next trivia competition is up also with a completly
                Episode II theme. Well done again to Gabe for coming first.<br><br>I'm also hoping soon to re-vamp the
                member section of the site. This won't be for a while yet (until I get a bit of free time) but I'll contact
                you all about any changes.</p>

            <h1>November 10, 2002</h1>
            <p>The news archive for October 2002 has been added.<br><br>I also wanted to scan two articles from the RTÉ
                Guide. One on Liam Neeson and one on Harrison Ford, but the magazines have disappeared, like so many others,
                before I got the chance. If anybody else knows of the articles in question and is able to scan them then
                please send them on. That also goes for any other article of interest in the Irish press.<br><br>The poll
                has finally been changed. To be honest with you I almost forgot about it.</p>
