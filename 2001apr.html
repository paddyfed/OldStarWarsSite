<P>April 30&#44; 2001</P><P>Not much of an update this week. As its the end of April the Archives will soon be added to.<BR><BR>There is a new poll on the main page with the results of the previous poll recorded.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>April 17&#44; 2001</P><P>Three new things to be added this time...<BR><BR>A new member has joined the ISW. Welcome to John O'Connell.<BR><BR>A new link in the Star Wars links page to the Jedi Temple. Supplied by Logan. Check it out it looks like a good site. <A HREF="link_sw.html" class="news">Star Wars Links</A>.<BR><BR>And a new poll on the main page.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>April 13&#44; 2001</P><P>With the recent redesign of the official site I just had to express my opinion on the new look site. Which is why there is a new editorial in the <A HREF="ed.html" class="news">editorial section</A>. I hope you will read it and give me your opinion on the subject.<BR><BR>I read this in the BackChat section of this week's RT&#201; Guide.<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Mook Skywalker</I><BR>Following the er, iffy critical response to Phantom Menace, it looks as if George Lucas has nixed on the chance to direct the next part of the blockbusting instalment. Amazingly, it's his old china, Martin Scorsese, who is tipped to take on the rains. Expect to see Luke "The Mook" Skywalker exorting Darth Maul to "go home and get his shinebox"; and Yoda to deliver the immortal catchphrase, "talking to me, you are?"</BLOCKQUOTE>While I don't believe that this is true it is quite funny to see it in the magazine.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>April 9&#44; 2001</P><P>There are now two new members to the ISW. Poisson D'Avril and Paul. Welcome to you both.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
