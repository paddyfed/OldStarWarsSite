            <h1>February 27, 2001</h1>
            <p>Sorry about the lack of updates this and last weekend but unfortunatly I have been dosed with he flu and have
                been unable to update the site.<br><br>We here at the ISW, I'm sure, were shocked to hear of the sudden
                illness of David Prowse (aka Darth Vader). I'm sure all the members will join me in wishing him a full and
                steady recovery.<br><br>Recently I notced that the RTÃ‰ football programme, 'The Premiership', has begun to
                use the Star Wars tune 'Duel of the Fates' for the advert for the programme. I think this is the first time
                an Irish programme has used Star Wars music in their adverts but correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>As a new
                addition to the homepage I have placed our own countdown to Episode II on the homepage. This is set to the
                approximate release date here in Ireland. (based on the release date for Episode I). Thanks to <a
                    href="404.html" target="_blank">the JavaScript Source</a> for this and other
                scripts on the site.</p>

            <h1>February 18, 2001</h1>
            <p><a href="https://www.theforce.net" target="_blank">TheForce.net</a> has updated their earlier report about
                the Sky Premier's showing of The Phantom Menace. It now appears that all four films will be shown on the
                channel on successive weeks, beginning on 17th March (St. Patrick's Day). At first I thought it was strange
                that they were starting with A New Hope but I see that they are trying to build up the excitement for the
                premiere of The Phantom Menace. Read the full article <a
                    href="404.html" target="_blank">here</a><br><br>There is also a
                new poll on the site with the results of the previous poll recorded.</p>

            <h1>February 11, 2001</h1>
            <p><a href="https://www.theforce.net" target="_blank">TheForce.net</a> has reported that The Phantom Menace will
                be shown on Sky Premier sometime in the near future. This will be the first time that the film will be seen
                on British television and will be the first oppertunity for those Irish fans who have the channel to see it.
                I wouldn't expect to see the film on Irish terrestrial channels for at least another year. See the article
                <a href="404.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>Liam Neeson was
                meantioned in the "Ireland on Sunday's" top 50 richest people in Ireland. While he wasn't in the top 50 he
                was one of the significant entertainers who were 'becoming rich' as the article stated. Other notable
                entrants in this list were Pierce Brosnan, Roy Keane and The Corrs.</p>
