<P>February 27&#44; 2001</P><P>Sorry about the lack of updates this and last weekend but unfortunatly I have been dosed with he flu and have been unable to update the site.<BR><BR>We here at the ISW, I'm sure, were shocked to hear of the sudden illness of David Prowse (aka Darth Vader). I'm sure all the members will join me in wishing him a full and steady recovery.<BR><BR>Recently I notced that the RTE football programme, 'The Premiership', has begun to use the Star Wars tune 'Duel of the Fates' for the advert for the programme. I think this is the first time an Irish programme has used Star Wars music in their adverts but correct me if I'm wrong.<BR><BR>As a new addition to the homepage I have placed our own countdown to Episode II on the homepage. This is set to the approximate release date here in Ireland. (based on the release date for Episode I). Thanks to <A HREF="http://javascript.internet.com" TARGET="_blank" class="news">the JavaScript Source</A> for this and other scripts on the site.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P> 
<P>February 18&#44; 2001</P><P><A HREF="http://www.theforce.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">TheForce.net</A> has updated their earlier report about the Sky Premier's showing of The Phantom Menace. It now appears that all four films will be shown on the channel on successive weeks, beginning on 17th March (St. Patrick's Day). At first I thought it was strange that they were starting with A New Hope but I see that they are trying to build up the excitement for the premiere of The Phantom Menace. Read the full article <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net/holonet/index.html#9353" TARGET="_blank" class="news">here</A><BR><BR>There is also a new poll on the site with the results of the previous poll recorded.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>February 11&#44; 2001</P><P><A HREF="http://www.theforce.net" TARGET="_blank" class="news">TheForce.net</A> has reported that The Phantom Menace will be shown on Sky Premier sometime in the near future. This will be the first time that the film will be seen on British television and will be the first oppertunity for those Irish fans who have the channel to see it. I wouldn't expect to see the film on Irish terrestrial channels for at least another year. See the article <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net/episode1/index.html#9300" TARGET="_blank" class="news">here</A>.<BR><BR>Liam Neeson was meantioned in the "Ireland on Sunday's" top 50 richest people in Ireland. While he wasn't in the top 50 he was one of the significant entertainers who were 'becoming rich' as the article stated. Other notable entrants in this list were Pierce Brosnan, Roy Keane and The Corrs.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>February 4&#44; 2001</P><P>January 2001 is now over so the archives have been added. They now include the news stories for January.<BR><BR>There is also a new poll up.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
