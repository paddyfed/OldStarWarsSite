            <h1>September 25, 2001</h1>
            <p>I know it's been ages since I've updated the site and I apologise but Star Wars and most everything else has
                taken a back seat recently. I think you'll agree. I have also started back at college and my time is
                pressed. However I am working away at a new design for the site. Something which I hope you will like. So
                don't expect too many updates in the recent days & weeks.</p>

            <h1>September 4, 2001</h1>
            <p>August has come and gone and Star Wars news continues. However no news on the Irish side though. I recently
                got the UK Star Wars magazine and it said that the Episode I DVD will be about £25 Stirling which equates to
                about £30 Punt or €40 euro (see I'm doing my bit <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-tongue"></i>). News archives have been added to and I'm working on
                something special for the site that should be ready soon (I hope).</p>
