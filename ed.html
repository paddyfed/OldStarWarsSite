<!-- THIS IS WHERE THE BODY STARTS -->
For almost a year now I have single-handedly maintained this site for the Irish fans of Star Wars. It has been a good year and, as I’ve said before, I never expected people to be interested in the site. e have had many changes to the site and a few additions, some that have remained strong and some that didn’t have much support.
<BR><BR>
However this editorial is not about this site’s upcoming anniversary. It is, however, very important to the development of the site. For all the time I have maintained the site I have done so without any financial gains or losses. In other words I’ve neither spent or received money from the site. This situation has worked well so far and I’m sure that all members are happy.
<BR><BR>
However I believe that this site could do so much more if only we had financial aid. For this reason I am thinking of placing some pop-up banners on the site. This service will pay me for every visitor that comes to the site. I am telling you (the members) about this because this is your site as well as mine. Is this a good idea? Will you still support the site if I do this?
<BR><BR>
All money from this service will go straight back to the site. We could pay for a professional URL with no ad’s. We could also have our own forum or professional chat room. It will also help to pay for features that would help maintain the site. No more endless searching for freeware programs or feeling guilty about overusing shareware.
<BR><BR>
None of this money will be used for my own personal use. Nor will it be used in any inappropriate way. Also, I want to make clear, I will NEVER ask members to donate or pay for the site. I don’t believe that you need to pay just to say that you’re a fan of Star Wars, especially an Irish fan.
<BR><BR>
Please give me your input. This is the most important thing I have ever asked you.
