            <h1>April 13, 2001</h1>
            <p>With the recent redesign of the official site I just had to express my opinion on the new look site. Which is
                why there is a new editorial in the <a href="ed.html">editorial section</a>. I hope you will
                read it and give me your opinion on the subject.<br><br>I read this in the BackChat section of this week's
                RTÃ‰ Guide.
            <blockquote><i>Mook Skywalker</i><br>Following the er, iffy critical response to Phantom Menace, it looks as if
                George Lucas has nixed on the chance to direct the next part of the blockbusting instalment. Amazingly, it's
                his old china, Martin Scorsese, who is tipped to take on the rains. Expect to see Luke "The Mook" Skywalker
                exorting Darth Maul to "go home and get his shinebox"; and Yoda to deliver the immortal catchphrase,
                "talking to me, you are?"</blockquote>While I don't believe that this is true it is quite funny to see it in
            the magazine.</p>
