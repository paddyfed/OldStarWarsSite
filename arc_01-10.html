            <h1>October 22, 2001</h1>
            <p>Here it finally is, Version 3 of the ISW is up and, mostly, running. Tell me what you think of the new design
                and any bugs in the system. All sections are not fully implamented yet so you still have to be
                patient.<br><br>My home computer is well and truely failed on me now and I don't know when I'll be able to
                get it back so all updates will be made from college.</p>

                stopped. But as always our affiliate <a href="https://www.galacticempire.net"

            <h1>October 2, 2001</h1>
            <p>I've had a bit of a crisis at home. My hard-drive has crashed and I can do nothing with my computer. It is
                currently being formatted. Sorry about the inconvenience.<br><br>I haven't updated the archives yet because
                of the problem and if there are any applications sent to me I won't recieve them until the computer is
                fixed.</p>
