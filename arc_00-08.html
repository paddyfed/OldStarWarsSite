<P>August 23&#44; 2000</P><P>Recently I have been thinking of a mascot or a character from the Star Wars universe that would represent our little group&#46; I thought long and hard and I finally decided on Yoda&#46; But I didn't want just ANY old Yoda&#44; I wanted a unique Yoda&#46; Well you cant get more unique than the Yoda from Rich Cando's 'Star Dudes'&#153;&#46; Rich has given me permission to use his Yoda as the mascot for our site which means you will be seeing more of this little guy in the future&#44; and next time you are in Ireland&#44; Rich&#44; give us a call and I will buy you that Guinness &#58;&#41;&#46;<BR>I have become concerned that there aren't as many people entering the trivia competition&#46; I have decided to let this one run but if there aren't sufficent entries there may not be a second&#46; I hope that all the members of the site will enter&#44; after all it's only for fun&#46;</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>August 21&#44; 2000</P><P>Not much of an update this time&#44; just a few new pages and sections added to the site&#46; I also have created some banners for links to the site&#46; If you use these banners to link to us then I will return the favour&#46;<BR>Don't forget about the trivia competition&#44; there isn't a lot of time to get your entries in&#46;</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>

<P>August 15&#44; 2000</P><P>Tell all your Star Wars friends about the Trivia competition&#44; I want to get as many entries as I can&#46; I also hope that the members of the club will enter the competition&#46; The top three ranked members of the club will all get a small reward&#46;</P>

<P>August 12&#44; 2000</P><P>The very first Trivia competition has now been set&#46; It is open to all visitors to the site but the member of the club with the highest ranking wins a small award for the members page for their achievement&#46;</P>
