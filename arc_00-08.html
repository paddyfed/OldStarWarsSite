            <p>Sabb has now become the fifth member of the ISW, a big welcome to him.<br>I hope you like the slight redesign
                of the site. I'm not very good with graphics for web sites but I think the design comes off well. If you
                have any suggestions as to what sections you would like to see on the site, don't hesitate to <a
                    href="contact.html">e-mail me.</a> Finally don't forget about the trivia, only
                13 days left to enter.</p>

            <p>Welcome to Steve McNally who has become the fourth member of the ISW.</p>

            <h1>August 23, 2000</h1>
            <p>Recently I have been thinking of a mascot or a character from the Star Wars universe that would represent our
                little group. I thought long and hard and I finally decided on Yoda. But I didn't want just ANY old Yoda, I
                wanted a unique Yoda. Well you cant get more unique than the Yoda from Rich Cando's 'Star Dudes'. Rich
                has given me permission to use his Yoda as the mascot for our site which means you will be seeing more of
                this little guy in the future, and next time you are in Ireland, Rich, give us a call and I will buy you
                that Guinness <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i>.<br>I have become concerned that there aren't as many people entering the trivia
                competition. I have decided to let this one run but if there aren't sufficent entries there may not be a
                second. I hope that all the members of the site will enter, after all it's only for fun.</p>

            <h1>August 21, 2000</h1>
            <p>Not much of an update this time, just a few new pages and sections added to the site. I also have created
                some banners for links to the site. If you use these banners to link to us then I will return the
                favour.<br>Don't forget about the trivia competition, there isn't a lot of time to get your entries in.</p>

            <h1>August 15, 2000</h1>
            <p>Tell all your Star Wars friends about the Trivia competition, I want to get as many entries as I can. I also
                hope that the members of the club will enter the competition. The top three ranked members of the club will
                all get a small reward.</p>

            <p>Welcome to YamaDarma who has become the third member of the ISW. The trivia results have started coming in
                and I just have to say that I'll have to make them a little harder the next time.</p>

            <h1>August 12, 2000</h1>
            <p>The very first Trivia competition has now been set. It is open to all visitors to the site but the member of
                the club with the highest ranking wins a small award for the members page for their achievement.</p>

            <h1>August 8, 2000</h1>
            <p>I found an article on Bronagh Gallagher, who played the captain of the Republic Cruiser in "The Phantom
                Menace." She talks a little about her role in the film but she mostly talks about her role in the new
                sit-com on the BBC, "The Fitz." The full article can be found <a href="404.html">here</a> from
                the Ireland on Sunday main site.</p>

            <p>We, the members of the ISW, would like to extend our sympathies to the family and friends of Sir Alec
                Guinness who played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original Star Wars and who died at the weekend.</p>

            <p>We have a new enemy...er...member to the club. Welcome Mollyjedi, the first member of the ISW. The Links page is
                now up and running with a few of my favourite links.</p>

            <h1>August 4, 2000</h1>
            <p>The application form is now uploaded and I am accepting your applications to join the fan club. The results
                page on the left is where I will post the results of the trivia and any other competitions. Obviously it is
                not completed yet <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-tongue"></i>. I am working on some trivia questions at the minute so you can expect to see
                trivia set I up soon. That's all the updates for now, keep on telling other Irish fans about the site and
                keep thinking of links for the links page.</p>

            <h1>August 2, 2000</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the [UNOFFICIAL] Irish Star Wars Fan Club or the "ISW" for short. I am the administrator of the
                club. The site is not up and running completly yet so bear with me.<br>As you can see I intend to create a
                trivia section and a links section. The winner of each Trivia set will be awarded a prize (nothing special
                just a small graphic for the members page) and I intend to have these trivia competitions every month. If
                you have any links you wish to be added to the links section please let me know. They can be Star Wars
                related but they can also be any sites that you found interesting.<br>As of yet I am not accepting
                applications for joining (mainly because I haven't created the form yet) but when the site is fully
                operational I will gladly accept applications.</p>
