            <h1>July 31, 2001</h1>
            <p>I was going to put the pop-up ads on the site this week but judging by the response to the latest poll I
                think I'll wait awhile. However I do want peoples opinions. If we don't have the pop-up ads, why not and are
                there any other alternatives?<br><br>The site has also had a few changes in the background which should
                ensure faster loading (I hope).<br><br>July 2001 has been added to the archives.</p>

            <h1>July 22, 2001</h1>
            <p>I have recieved a new application for membership of the ISW however, I am skeptical of the authenticity of
                the applicant. However I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Welcome to Euan McGregor to the
                ISW.<br><br>The ISW Chat Room is now open. You don't have to register to use the chat room and it's
                completly free. Please check it out and tell me what you think.<br><br>A new poll has been set and the
                previous poll results have been recorded.<br><br>Trivia set VI is now open and to celebrate our affiliation
                with GalacticEmpire.net it is a special Trivia set all about the website.</p>

            <h1>July 12, 2001</h1>
            <p>Sorry about the rude alert but this editorial is very important and I want everyone to read it. The poll has
                been moved to a different page because it was getting too cluttered on the page.<br><br>We have now been
                affiliated with <a href="https://www.galacticempire.net" target="_blank">The Galactic Empire Network</a> run
                by Palpatine. I have always believed that this was an inevitable affiliation seeing as we use some of the
                features from the site. In celebration of this I will be dedicating our sixth Trivia competition to the
                site.<br><br>If you read the notice on GEN about our affiliation you will see that Palpatine uses my real
                name and perhaps it is time that I stopped hiding behind this anon. name (ISW Admin) and used my own. My
                name is Patrick but my friends call me Paddy and I've been a serious fan of Star Wars ever since I got the
                videos in 1995. I live in Co. Monaghan in Ireland and I go to college in Letterkenny. Recently I have
                started building a <a href="https://www.geocities.com/paddyfedoo" target="_blank">site for myself</a> but
                it's pretty empty at the minute. I like to use my online persona, PaddyFedoo, for posting to newsgroups and
                chat-rooms.</p>

            <p>The requests page is now open. I hope you will all view it and see what type of service that it is. I hope
                that this will be a regular feature and that I won't have to abandon it after a week <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i>. <br><br>As you can
                see, yes I do have plans to introduce a chat section very soon. Keep your eye out for that.<br><br>I have
                also managed to scrape togeher a few trivia questions so I hope to be restarting that. I hope our 3 times
                champion, PhantomShadow, is ready to defend his title.<br><br>I also have some more important updates and
                announcements soon so please keep in touch.</p>
