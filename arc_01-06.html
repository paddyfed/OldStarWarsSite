            <p>If you look at the '<a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a>' section you will find a new form which (hopefully)
                enables those with web-mail to send messages directly to me. I'm not sure how well it is working so I would
                appreciate if you could test it out by sending a few messages.<br><br>I hope to have the 'Requests' page up
                and running as soon as possible. When that happens I hope to have a full explanation of the
                section.<br><br>I think I may have found a chat program for the site. As of yet I haven't checked it out
                fully so nothing final yet.<br><br>I was sent a link via e-mail from the author of an edited version of
                Episode I. No not THE Phantom Edit, just a different version. This is what the author had to say:
            <blockquote>Imagine...<br>No Jar Jar. More Qui-gon/Obi-wan interaction. More Yoda. <br>Midichlorians? What
                Midichlorians? It is no longer a dream.<br><br>the Jar Jar-free rewrite of Episode I <a

                    target="_blank">www.angelfire.com/dc/script/index.html</a><br><br>spread the word.</blockquote>Well,
            I've read some of it and I don't think much of it. However I'll let you make up your own mind.</p>

            <p>Well, what an announcement. The Episode I DVD is now officially on its way. No release date stated for
                Ireland so I assume it'll be the same as in Britain, October 15th. With all the additional material that is
                going into the disk as well it would seem that our prediction of a 'bare bones' DVD was also wrong. Although
                I won't be buying the DVD at this stage, I don't believe that I won't get the opportunity to see it before
                2006. For more insight on my opinion of the DVD, check out this <a href="editorial_01.html">old editorial</a>. Also
                please give us <a href="mailto:star-wars-ed@iol.ie">your opinion</a>.<br><br>A new poll is also up. Check
                out the results of the old poll.<br><b>Update:</b> There are some problems with the site <a
                    href="https://www.freetools.com" target="_blank">freetools.com</a> where the poll comes from so I am
                unable to change the poll at this time.</p>

            <p>A new member has joined the ISW bringing our membership up to 26. Welcome to Kerry Mullins.<br><br>This weeks
                RTÃ‰ Guide has a special report on some of the biggest earning celebrities including the one and only George
                Lucas.
            <blockquote><b>George Lucas &#36;250 Million</b><br>The Force was definatly with Lucas last year, even though he
                resisted <i>Star Wars'</i> fans call for him to release <i>The Phantom Menace</i> on DVD. However, the
                cassette sals and rentals alone made the movie the fourth biggest video of 2000.</blockquote>Other notable
            entrants in the list are Stephen Spielberg, the Beatles and Michael Schumacher.</p>

            <p>Bronagh Gallagher, the captain of the New Republic Cruiser in Episode I, is starring in a new film which will
                be released during the summer. Here is a small quote about the film from 'The Sunday Tribune'
            <blockquote><b>The Most Fertile Man in Ireland</b><br>Kris Marshall is a sex-shy Belfast bachelor with a mega
                sperm count who teams up with Bronagh Gallagher to share his riches with would-be mums.</blockquote>
            According to the article it will open on the week of 24th August.</p>

            <p>Whew! May really flew by without me noticing. Thankfully I'm now finished college until September so I can
                dedicate more time to the site. This week there are a few updates so bear with me.<br><br>The links section
                has a new section. International Star Wars fan clubs. You can see how our sister clubs operate, some of
                which have great designs and page layouts. Check them out.<br><br>Both the Poll and the Archive sections
                have been updated. The archives now includes a very short May 2001.</p>
