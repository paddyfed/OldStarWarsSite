            <p>Due to some restrictions on Palpy's message forum he is no longer able to host our forum there. This is why
                it no longer appears on the menu. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Palps for all his support to
                the site over the past year and a bit and I hope we'll be able to help each other again.<br><br>I'd also
                like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your support in 2001 and that you have a Happy New Year
                and a great 2002.</p>

            <p>I've just recieved word that the Galactic Empire UK 'Banner Exchange' is no longer working or being supported
                so the <a href="index.html">index or 'splash'</a> page has been changed to reflect this.<br><br>I've started
                up the polls again with one about the Episode II trailers (only 150 days left). Unfortunatly I haven't got
                the previous poll results finished yet. Click on the <a href="poll.html">Polls</a> link to view it.</p>

            <p>I went to Newry today with my family to do some christmas shopping. While I was there I had a look in Easons
                bookshop and bought three more NJO books. Am now looking forward to reading them.</p>

            <p>Well it's nearly Christmas again and we're one month closer to Episode II. Last year I changed the design of
                the site to a more Christmassy feel but I'm not sure if I'll do that this year.<br><br>The news archives for
                November have also been added.</p>
