                <P>February 6, 2003</P>
                <P>Just a quick note to tell you all that I'll change the poll whenever I get to college today, as well
                    as the update for January 2003. Yes that's right it's February already. Ive also updated the links
                    section. It's getting a bit scarce.<BR><BR>Dave from <A HREF="http://www.pixelmasher.com"
                        TARGET="_blank">Pixel Masher</A> also e-mailed me about his Space Hopper Star Wars parody site
                    which was already mentioned on <A HREF="http://www.galacticempire.co.uk"
                        TARGET="_blank">GalacticEmpire.co.uk</A>.</P>

                <P>January 23, 2003</P>
                <P>I've had an email from one of the webmasters from <A HREF="http://www.dewbackwing-europe.com/"
                        TARGET="_blank">DewbackWing Europe</A>, he says that there is a section of their forum set up
                    specifically for Irish people. DewbackWing are mainly concerned with creating props and costumes
                    from Star Wars but they also have some RPG areas of the site. Check out the site <A
                        HREF="http://www.dewbackwing-europe.com/" TARGET="_blank">here</A>.<BR><BR>As you know the
                    Trivia competition has finished for a while again. Now I'm wondering, when I start the trivia
                    competition again, should I start the Trivia Table from scratch again or should it be continued on
                    from the last one? Or should I create a trivia table for the first five, the last five and the next
                    five trivia competitions? Seeing as ye are the ones who participate in the Trivia competitions you
                    should have your input on the subject. Just send us an <A HREF="contact.html">e-mail</A>.<BR><BR>In
                    other news my other web-site, <A HREF="http://paddyfedoo.andmuchmore.com" TARGET="_blank">PaddyFedoo
                        ONLINE</A>, (link may no longer be accessable) is having a bit of trouble. ProHosting who host
                    the site are trying to make me pay for it and while it must be said it is a low enough sum I'm just
                    not prepared to pay for the service which is at best, crap. So if you know of any FREE hosting sites
                    out there with FTP support, let us know.</P>

                <P>January 2, 2003</P>
                <P>I know, I know I've been idle on the site for a month and I'm sorry about that. Things just kept
                    getting in the way. Any way belated Merry Christmas and Happy 2003 to you all. I hope you all had a
                    good one and looking forward to another Star Wars packed year.<BR><BR>In terms of the site, not much
                    has happened. The trivia contest is over and Gabe has won again, however without anyone else
                    entering. Still nevermind. I think I'll take a small break from the trivia for a while. It'll give
                    me a bit of time to gather some more questions. Rest assured it will be back and quicker than the
                    last break. There's also something important I need to ask you (ie those who participate in the
                    trivia). More about that later though.</P>

                <P>December 3, 2002</P>
                <P>I have a few more scanned articles this week. One is an advert for Episode I which has its 'Premiere'
                    on UTV tonight, even though it has already been on RT�. Anyway read it <a
                        href="rteguide_epiguide.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> with the photo <a
                        href="rteguide_quigonpic.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.<BR><BR>The second scan is of a USI
                    (Union of Students in Ireland) leaflet for this years 'Grant' marches. It likens the Irish
                    Government to the 'Evil Empire'. The full size poster in the college is quite funny also. Click <a
                        href="usi_poster.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> to see the leaflet.<BR><BR>The archives for
                    November 2002 have been added.</P>
                <P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
                <P>November 24, 2002</P>
                <P>I was finally able to scan an article from the RT� Guide this week. It's only a small one about Ewan
                    McGregor. See it <A HREF="rteguide_ewanart.jpg">here</A> and the photo is <A
                        HREF="rteguide_ewanpic.jpg">here</A>.<BR><BR>The next trivia competition is up also with a
                    completly Episode II theme. Well done again to Gabe for coming first.<BR><BR>I'm also hoping soon to
                    re-vamp the member section of the site. This won't be for a while yet (until I get a bit of free
                    time) but I'll contact you all about any changes.</P>

                <P>November 10, 2002</P>
                <P>The news archive for October 2002 has been added.<BR><BR>I also wanted to scan two articles from the
                    RT� Guide. One on Liam Neeson and one on Harrison Ford, but the magazines have disappeared, like so
                    many others, before I got the chance. If anybody else knows of the articles in question and is able
                    to scan them then please send them on. That also goes for any other article of interest in the Irish
                    press.<BR><BR>The poll has finally been changed. To be honest with you I almost forgot about it.</P>

                <P>October 27, 2002</P>
                <P>We have a new Member Barry who has joined us. Welcome to him. Also the results of this months Trivia
                    competition are in. Well done to Gabe again for coming first. The new competition will be up until
