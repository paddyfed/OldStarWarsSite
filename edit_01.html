<h4 align="center">Patience is a Virtue<br>By PaddyFedoo, 3 January 2001</h4>

<!-- BODY -->
TheForce.net recently asked who doesn't want the Episode I DVD? Well I for one don't. I'm not just  saying this because I don't have a DVD player and have no immediate plans to get it. I'm saying this because I would prefer to see the DVD's in a boxed set. This said I will not mind if the Episode I DVD is released this year, I just won't buy it. Instead I will wait patiently for the full set to be released.
<BR><BR>
I will also be doing the same with the VHS versions when they are released. I have decided not to buy the re-released trilogy with the Episode II footage because I don't need to. I already have two versions of the trilogy. Instead I will wait until the whole set is complete before buying. This will keep me going until I do decide to buy the boxed set of the DVD's. I will still buy Episode II and III when it is released on VHS.
<BR><BR>
You may think that I am not looking forward to the DVD release, on the contrary I am excited about the release because I hear of all that is possible for DVD. GalacticEmpire.net used to have a feature on the site called 'The DVD' in which someone would explain all that could be put on the DVD. For example they said that three versions of 'A New Hope' (the original release, the special editions and any new edition) could be put onto one DVD. This could be repeated over all six movies. This doesn't include all the documentaries or left out scenes that could also be placed on it.
<BR><BR>
However if the Episode I DVD were released now it probably won't have any added scenes on it. The documentaries, yes but no new scenes. You will still have to buy the DVD again in five or six years to get this new version. If this was done for all the movies this could add up to a lot of DVD purchases not including any VHS releases in the mean time. As you can imagine this would be a great expense to all the fans (but loads of revenue to George Lucas).
<BR><BR>
Another plus about waiting is the fact that after so many years of waiting, you can finally get to see the full saga, in it's entirety and in any new form for the first time. I believe it would be like watching the saga all over again, with new eyes. By this time there could also have been great advances in DVD technology. They could be of better quality, they may be able to store more information and any bugs or faults that are in the system at the minute could've been ironed out by that stage.
<BR><BR>
So what will you do if (and when) the Episode I DVD is released this year? Will you buy it and enjoy it now? Will you rent it out and enjoy it in the short term? Will you get a mate to buy it and go around to his/her house every time you want to watch it? Or will you, like me, wait patiently until 2006 to when the full Star Wars saga, all six movies, is released possibly in a new form and enjoy them all over again?

<H4 align="center">DVD? There aint no such thing<br>By Tipplehilti, 6 January 2001</H4>
Due to the lack of any big news on the EII front since principal photography was completed , the acronym at the tip of everybodies tongues at the minute is.......D.V.D., 
why?, because Lucasfilm insist that instead of releasing the goods now (they'd rather not cash in on 6 years interim revenue) , theyll only release a 6DVD box set in 2006 so packed full of extras and bonus footage you'll be mad not to get one. 
<BR><BR>
I for one dont believe it. 
<BR><BR>Certain fans vigorously support Lucasfilm on their stance on DVD, but when have they ever missed an opportunity to earn more money?, 
the DVD editions will be no different then the special edition VHS trilogy - create an artificial shortage, then there will be a demand and <i>then</i> theyll release the films in new packaging and we'll all be very happy. 
<BR><BR>
IMO, within the next 18 months they'll release the bare bones TPM DVD, and maybe the trilogy DVDs if we really go mad, of course we'll all buy them and we'll all buy the special edition DVDs in 2006, Lucasfilm will play good guys and claim they bowed to the demand from fans.its almost too perfect. 
were all winners (including Lucas), oh.... except for the people who claim Lucasfilm are bastions of morality and have some integrity when it comes to cashing in on the fans who only want a measly bare bones DVD.... 
<BR><BR>
Thats not too much to ask....
