<P>June 30&#44; 2001</P><P>If you look at the '<A HREF="cont.html" class="news">Contact Me</A>' section you will find a new form which (hopefully) enables those with web-mail to send messages directly to me. I'm not sure how well it is working so I would appreciate if you could test it out by sending a few messages.<BR><BR>I hope to have the 'Requests' page up and running as soon as possible. When that happens I hope to have a full explanation of the section.<BR><BR>I think I may have found a chat program for the site. As of yet I haven't checked it out fully so nothing final yet.<BR><BR>I was sent a link via e-mail from the author of an edited version of Episode I. No not THE Phantom Edit, just a different version. This is what the author had to say:<BLOCKQUOTE>Imagine...<BR>No Jar Jar. More Qui-gon/Obi-wan interaction. More Yoda. <BR>Midichlorians? What Midichlorians? It is no longer a dream.<BR><BR>the Jar Jar-free rewrite of Episode I <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/dc/script/index.html" TARGET="_blank" class="news">www.angelfire.com/dc/script/index.html</A><BR><BR>spread the word.</BLOCKQUOTE>Well, I've read some of it and I don't think much of it. However I'll let you make up your own mind.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>

<P>June 25&#44; 2001</P><P>Well, what an announcement. The Episode I DVD is now officially on its way. No release date stated for Ireland so I assume it'll be the same as in Britain, October 15th. With all the additional material that is going into the disk as well it would seem that our prediction of a 'bare bones' DVD was also wrong. Although I won't be buying the DVD at this stage, I don't believe that I won't get the opportunity to see it before 2006. For more insight on my opinion of the DVD, check out this <A HREF="ed_01.html" class="news">old editorial</A>. Also please give us <A HREF="mailto:star-wars-ed@iol.ie" class="news">your opinion</A>.<BR><BR>A new poll is also up. Check out the results of the old poll.<BR><B>Update:</B> There are some problems with the site <A HREF="http://www.freetools.com" TARGET="_blank" class="news">freetools.com</A> where the poll comes from so I am unable to change the poll at this time.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>June 19&#44; 2001</P><P>A new member has joined the ISW bringing our membership up to 26. Welcome to Kerry Mullins.<BR><BR>This weeks RT&#201; Guide has a special report on some of the biggest earning celebrities including the one and only George Lucas. <BLOCKQUOTE><B>George Lucas &#36;250 Million</B><BR>The Force was definatly with Lucas last year, even though he resisted <I>Star Wars'</I> fans call for him to release <I>The Phantom Menace</I> on DVD. However, the cassette sals and rentals alone made the movie the fourth biggest video of 2000.</BLOCKQUOTE>Other notable entrants in the list are Stephen Spielberg, the Beatles and Michael Schumacher.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>June 11&#44; 2001</P><P>Bronagh Gallagher, the captain of the New Republic Cruiser in Episode I, is starring in a new film which will be released during the summer. Here is a small quote about the film from 'The Sunday Tribune'<BLOCKQUOTE><B>The Most Fertile Man in Ireland</B><BR>Kris Marshall is a sex-shy Belfast bachelor with a mega sperm count who teams up with Bronagh Gallagher to share his riches with would-be mums.</BLOCKQUOTE>According to the article it will open on the week of 24th August.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="rule.gif" HEIGHT="10" WIDTH="100"></P>
<P>June 3&#44; 2001</P><P>Whew! May really flew by without me noticing. Thankfully I'm now finished college until September so I can dedicate more time to the site. This week there are a few updates so bear with me.<BR><BR>The links section has a new section. International Star Wars fan clubs. You can see how our sister clubs operate, some of which have great designs and page layouts. Check them out.<BR><BR>Both the Poll and the Archive sections have been updated.
