            <h1>December 31, 2000</h1>
            <p>I recently looked at the site and realised that the news page could not be viewed properly. I apologise
                if
                you weren't able to view the site and I hope it has been fixed.<br><br>There is an interesting report on
                <a href="https://www.theforce.net" target="_blank">TheForce.net</a> about a small memento that Liam
                Neeson
                has kept after his accident. You can read it <a href="404.html"
                    target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Whew! what a hectic week its been so far, I've hardly had time to sit down. On top of all that the country
                is
                covered in snow. It's not even new years yet! Anyway sorry about the lack of updates recently.<br><br>I
                am
                glad to see that a few more posts have been put onto the forum (besides mine) If you can think of any
                interesting topics that you would like to discuss just <a
                    href="404.html"
                    target="_blank">post 'em up</a>.</p>

            <p>A new member has joined the ISW called Gold Leader. This brings the total number of members to 17. Also
                we
                have had more visitors this month than any other month so far. This brings the total number of visitors
                to
                over 800 which is quite an achievement. Not long to go until the big 1000.<br><br>Also if I don't get to
                say
                it before the day itself, Merry Christmas to all the members and visitors of the ISW.</p>

            <h1>December 17, 2000</h1>
            <p>Well its near the end of the college term and the Christmas holidays. With this I hopefully will be
                writing
                my own editorial to get the ball rolling, so to speak. If you want to submit your own editorial please
                <a href="contact.html">email me</a>. To see some examples of the type of editorials that I
                am
                looking for go to the <a href="404.html"
                    target="_blank">Galactic Empire's editorial section</a>.<br><br>A new poll is also up in the polls
                section. <a href="poll.html">Do you read any Episode II spoilers?</a>. The results of the last poll are
                also
                up.</p>

                download from <a href="https://www.theforce.net" target="_blank">TheForce.net</a>. 'Return of the Dude'
                can

            <h1>December 9, 2000</h1>
            <p>The film 'Excalibur' was on RTÉ 1 last night. Liam Neeson played one of the knights of the round table
                (Gawain) and he fought Sir Lancelot in a duel for Queen Guenevere's innocence. Another point of interest
                about this film is that someone once suggested that the plot of Episode II or Episode III would have
                similarities with this film.<br><br>Also 'Much ado about Nothing' is on RTÉ 1 on Sunday morning. Brian
                Blessed being amongst the cast.</p>

            <h1>December 8, 2000</h1>
            <p>Sorry about the lack of updates last week. Something happened to either my FTP program or the FTP server
                and
                it wouldn't allow me to upload files. To view updates from last week, check below.<br><br>I've still
                been
                unable to find the widescreen versions of the trilogy at a reasonable price. The best I can find is
                still
                IR�42.99. If you see it for a better price anywhere else <a href="contact.html">tell
                    me</a>.<br><br>Don't forget about the <a href="poll.html">poll</a> and try to get involved in the <a

            <h1>December 3, 2000</h1>
            <p>We have a new member to the site, Hans solo has joined the ranks of the ISW. He also brings with him news
                of
                a site that will allow users to order Star Wars merchandise on-line without using a credit card.
                Unfortunatly he doesn't have a URL for the site yet but do you think this will be a good idea for Irish
                fans? He says the site should be available within the next week, I'll keep you posted.<br><br>There is
                an
                article about Natalie Portman in this weeks RTÉ Guide (December 2 - 7, 2000). Star Wars is mentioned
                only
                once, however.
            <blockquote>You could accuse her of succombing to the percieved evils of commercial success for taking the
                role
                of Queen Amidala in the inergalactic sci-fi franchise Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. She shrugs off the
                notion, describing her time on set with Lucas and co as "a fun way to spend my 16th summer".
            </blockquote>
            <br><br>In other news, the archives have been expanded to include November 2000. also there is a new poll
            up. <a href="poll.html">Did you/will you buy the new trilogy box set?</a></p>
