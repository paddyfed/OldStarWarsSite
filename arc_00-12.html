<p>December 31&#44; 2000</P><p>I recently looked at the site and realised that the news page could not be viewed properly. I apologise if you weren't able to view the site and I hope it has been fixed.<br><br>There is an interesting report on <a href="http://www.theforce.net" target="_blank" class="news">TheForce.net</a> about a small memento that Liam Neeson has kept after his accident. You can read it <a href="http://www.theforce.net/holonet/index.html#8869" target="_blank" class="news">here</a>.<p align="center"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>December 28&#44; 2000</P><P>Whew! what a hectic week its been so far, I've hardly had time to sit down. On top of all that te country is covered in snow. It's not even new ears yet! Anyway sorry about the lack of updates recently.<BR><BR>I am glad to see that a few more posts have been put onto the forum (besides mine) If you can think of any interesting topics that you would like to discuss just <A HREF="http://cgi.imperialsenate.co.uk/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&number=15&start=here" TARGET="_blank" class="news">post 'em up</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>December 23&#44; 2000</P><P>A new member has joined the ISW called Gold Leader. This brings the total number of members to 17. Also we have had more visitors this month than any other month so far. This brings the total number of visitors to over 800 which is quite an achievement. Not long to go until the big 1000.<BR><BR>Also if I don't get to say it before the day itself, Merry Christmas to all the members and visitors of the ISW.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>December 17&#44; 2000</P><P>Well its near the end of the college term and the Christmas holidays. With this I hopefully will be writing my own editorial to get the ball rolling, so to speak. If you want to submit your own editorial please <A HREF="mailto:star-wars-ed@iol.ie" class="news">email me</A>. To see some examples of the type of editorials that I am looking for go to the <A HREF="http://www.galacticempire.net/features/editorials.shtml" TARGET="_blank" class="news">Galactic Empire's editorial section</A>.<BR><BR>A new poll is also up in the polls section. <A HREF="poll.html" class="news">Do you read any Episode II spoilers?</A>. The results of the last poll are also up.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>December 10&#44; 2000</P><P>In case you didn't hear it from anywhere else, the next chapter in the Star Dudes saga is now available for download from <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net" TARGET="_blank" CLASS="news">TheForce.net</A>. 'Return of the Dude' can be found <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net/theater/animation/returndude/index.shtml" TARGET="_blank" CLASS="news">here</A>. Don't forget that the rest of the Star Dudes series can be found on TheForce.net.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>December 9&#44; 2000</P><P>The film 'Excalibur' was on RT&#201; 1 last night. Liam Neeson played one of the knights of the round table (Gawain) and he fought Sir Lancelot in a duel for Queen Guenevere's innocence. Another point of interest about this film is that someone once suggested that the plot of Episode II or Episode III would have similarities with this film.<BR><BR>Also 'Much ado about Nothing' is on RT&#201; 1 on Sunday morning. Brian Blessed being amongst the cast.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>December 8&#44; 2000</P><P>Sorry about the lack of updates last week. Something happened to either my FTP program or the FTP server and it wouldn't allow me to upload files. To view updates from last week, check below.<BR><BR>I've still been unable to find the widescreen versions of the trilogy at a reasonable price. The best I can find is still IR£42.99. If you see it for a better price anywhere else <A HREF="mailto:star-wars@iol.ie" CLASS="news">tell me</A>.<BR><BR>Don't forget about the <A HREF="poll.html" CLASS="news">poll</A> and try to get involved in the <A HREF="http://cgi.galacticempire.net/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&number=15&start=here" TARGET="_blank" CLASS="news">forum</A>.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
<P>December 3&#44; 2000</P><P>We have a new member to the site, Hans solo has joined the ranks of the ISW. He also brings with him news of a site that will allow users to order Star Wars merchandise on-line without using a credit card. Unfortunatly he doesn't have a URL for the site yet but do you think this will be a good idea for Irish fans? He says the site should be available within the next week, I'll keep you posted.<BR><BR>There is an article about Natalie Portman in this weeks RT&#201; Guide (December 2 - 7, 2000). Star Wars is mentioned only once, however.<BLOCKQUOTE>You could accuse her of succombing to the percieved evils of commercial success for taking the role of Queen Amidala in the inergalactic sci-fi franchise Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. She shrugs off the notion, describing her time on set with Lucas and co as "a fun way to spend my 16th summer".</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>In other news, the archives have been expanded to include November 2000. also there is a new poll up. <A HREF="poll.html" class="news">Did you/will you buy the new trilogy box set?</A></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="sys_rule.gif" width="120" height="10" alt="-"></P>
